These patterns resemble the distribution of disease and modes of spread of hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis B virus infectons occur very frequently among aidDDDAIDS cases.

It is transmitted by any excrement or secretion, including saliva, blood, urine, feces, and sperm. It is apparently fatal about 40% of the time. It has a estimated latency time of about a year, during which the victim is contagious but shows no symptoms. The relevance of this to net.singles is that it reminds me of a recent article in Time about sexually transmitted diseases. This article said there was a period when casual sex was possible. VD was easily cured. Then along came herpes. Now, for better or for worse, the choice of a partner could not be so care-free. This article even alluded to a wrathful God inflicting herpes as a punishment. Well, herpes may be painful and uncurable, but it is not fatal. Now here is a disease which is. I wonder if AIDS will encourage monogamy in cases where herpes hasn't. Apparently male homosexuals, who as a group tend to change partners frequently, are often victims of AIDS. I wonder what Time thinks of this. And, I wonder what you think of this.

It seems that there is general agreement over the method used in the surgery but very little agreement on the effectiveness, cost, availability, etc. I get the impression of a lack of communication in the United States or world medical community. However, here are the results; judge for yourselves: Rich Strebendt writes that he consulted with a doctor at the Wheaton Eye Clinic in Wheaton Illinois about the operation. He was told that the operation is available but that it provides minimal correction and is used only in cases of mild myopia. Since his myopia was advanced to a point that he would require continued use of glasses, his doctor advised against it and he followed the advice. Nanak Shukla (told me in person) that he has approached his opthalmologist seeking the operation and was told that the operation is used only in severe cases of myopia and that he was advised against it. Nanak does not have a mild case of myopia. Tim Maroney wrote that the procedure is call ""Radial-K"" surgery. It was discovered by accident in the Soviet Union when a teenaged boy received glass cuts of the eye and his vision was tremendously improved. He doubts that the procedure is available because the long term effects are not known. He also wrote of another procedure in which the cornea is actually removed from the eye, frozen, lathed to proper shape, and re-implanted. (Editor's note: I am not entirely sure, but I think that this is a surgical procedure for cataracts rather than correction of myopia). Steven L Wagner submitted an article describing his brother's experience with the procedure called ""radial-keratotomy"" (the Radial-K above). To summarize, there are two versions, an old and a new. Each eye is done separately (to heal in the meantime). His brother has one eye with 16 slits (the old method) and one eye with the new (8 slits). There was a great increase in visual acuity. There are no visible side-effects, but his brother can notice the scars if he looks at the right thing. The eye is considered potentially more fragile after this procedure. Each eye cost about 1-1.5 K$. Finally, Mary Hauck write that she thought the procedure was not allowed in the U.S. Those are the replys, so far. Personally, it sounds to me as if there is an available procedure in the U.S. for correcting myopia but the long-term effects are not known. Possibly, the differing opinions and recommendations of doctors reflects the uncertainty of the procedure. I did note in the responses to this question that near-sighted people (myself included) seem to be hoping and praying for a miraculous procedure and rid themselves of the handicap of glasses, contacts, and even, imperfect vision even with aids. The encouraging sign is that medical science is actively seeking relief with research such as the ""Radial-K"" procedure.

I'm not sure I'd ignore AMA doctors, but I would try other approaches as well and choose the one that seems the best. The more general question is: If conventional medicine doesn't seem to cure a disease, should alternative techniques be ignored just because they seem odd? I say no. Of course, ""buyer beware"" is more critical for the alternative approaches since control of who gets licensed to do what is relatively loose, but I know there are some homeopaths that are far superior to physicians (as far as results go), and some chiropractors that are far superior to surgeons.

I think peopleshould be able to get married at the age of 14, or at any age,if they so desire.I worry about children who don't have knowledge of pregnancy andcontraception engaging in sexual activity. In crossgenerationalrelationships (or any heterosexual relationships for that matter),I consider this (contraception) to be the responsibility of themore knowledgeable (generally the older) partner.Perhaps if you had started having sex before you were 18, you wouldhave had more experience sooner and you would have been able tounderstand more of the ""implications"" earlier. Or maybe the""implications"" just would have been different.But anyway, I certainly agree with the right to celibacy mentionedby another contributor, and that includes a right to be free fromharassment for a sexuality which certainly doesn't require too muchconsent from others.As far as most of the rest of your comments go--Well, let's face it, flames fall in one of two categories: reasonedor unreasoned. I consider category 1 worthy of reply. That meanscategory 2 ain't worth the trouble. But when you consider yourselfglad that you're not gay because you ""would feel compelled to hunt downall of the members of NAMBL [sic] for giving people of my persuasiona bad name,"" I think you should consider two things:1) Many of us lesbian and gay folk may be glad to have a person ofyour insight refusing to identify with us.2) Many participants in crossgenerational sexuality are straight (i.e.your sexual orientation).The only reason crossgenerational lovers expect lesbians and gays tobetter understand our oppression is because lesbians and gays havehad to suffer similar oppression by similar segments of our society(don't worry, I won't mention any names).To: Laura Creighton (utzoo!utcsstat!laura)I agree that we should ""drop the age restriction (which isn't gonnawork anyway, people being as they are) and teach kids how not to bemanipulated through force or guilt"" at least to the extent that thatis possible.

AIDS patients may alsodevelop cancers rarely seen in the general population.Since it was first seen by physicians in 1980, AIDS has been diagnosedmostly in homosexual men, people who use intravenous drugs illegally, and,to a lessor extent, Haitians and hemophiliacs. It has been noted that homo-sexuals with a high number of partners seenm to beat greater risk of AIDS thanthose with fewer partners.The latest AIDS study, conducted at M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston,found that even in men without symptoms of disease, anal intercourse isassociated with abnormalities of the immune system.The study, conducted by Dr. Giora mavligit and colleagues, focused on 30asymptomic, monogamously paired homosexual men. Nineteen of 26 men who wererecipiants of sperm anally showed laboratory evidence of an immune responseto their partner's sperm.No evidence of such a response was found in the four men in the studywho never received sperm during intercourse.The response in some of the men involved infection fighters called T-cellsand was the same kind of reation strongly associated with AIDS. Theresearchers also studied one heterosexual couple who regularly practice analintercourse and found signs of the same immune reaction in the female.These findings support the theory that sperm entering the the anal canalare readily absorbed into a person's lymphatic and blood circulation systems,where they may set up an immune response as if they were invading infectiousagents.--________( ) Don Stanwyck@( o o )@ 312-979-3062( || ) Cornet-367-3062( \__/ ) ihnp4!ihuxr!stanwyck(______) Bell Labs @ Naperville, IL",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/8uPRq4T7RRs/m/VVEihnCu6lwJ,,,

Did someone say 'immune'? Doesn't AIDS have todo with the immune system? Could it be that people who engage insuch vile practices might actually be bringing it upon themselves?Hear ye, and repent now.""It reminds me a bit of Susan Sontag's expositions of the treatment oftuberculosis and cancer patients in her book, ""Illness as Metaphor"". Thechasm between labortatory-level immune system peculiarities and AIDS isquite wide, especially given the epidemiological evidence which would seemto implicate an infectious agent as the cause of AIDS. We must rememberthat the accused practice has been around for many millenia, as opposed toAIDS, which has emerged only in the last three years.A similar study was published a few years ago implicating vasectomies inauto-immune diseases. In this case, men were showing symptoms of immunereactions against their own sperm. Now the researchers (presumablythemselves intact) weren't saying much about vasectomies and AIDS then, butthey were warning of arthritis and heart disease. The fears stirred up bythat potboiler are only beginning to be dispelled by hard evidence showingno increase in either disease in vasectomized men.I should emphasize that I am not condemning basic research of any kind.But a study's conclusions and presentations are not immune (sorry) todeeply-ingrained bias.

The reason I came out was because I felt I could never lead a normal life as long as I was hiding such a large part of my life. How can you think positively about yourself if you are constantly negating yourself? How do you choose the right moment to come out to someone? Well, I really didn't want to make a big thing out of it - it shouldn't be a big deal - so when someone would ask me what I did over the weekend, I'd tell them I went dancing with Rick at the Foxhole, or I went to chorus rehearsal (Oh? What chorus? The Denver Gay Men's Chorus). This kept me from acting a scene out of ""True Confessions"", and allowed them to gloss over the matter without a confrontation. Coming out to my parents was different. Whatever reaction they had, I didn't want them to think they made me gay. They could hate me, feel sorry for me, anything, as long as they wouldn't think they were responsible. As it turned out, what hurt my mother most was that I hadn't told her sooner. She still worries about me (she's afraid I'll get knifed by a psychopathic lover, or get AIDS), but I'm closer to my family than I've ever been before.

Its formula is: C H N O 19 19 7 6 It helps in the growth of a healthy blood system and aids the intestinal tract to stay healthy. The bacteria in the intestines will ordinarily work to combine or synthesize various elements together to form folic acid. Once again, we see seemingly worthless bacteria working in a symbiotic manner. Not only do they produce vitamin B12, but produce Folic Acid. As Steve Dyer said, the suggested daily allowance is 400 Micrograms (0.4 Milligrams). So it seems logical that all we have to do is get our digestive tract in order to get enough B12 AND Folic Acid, produced for us by the bacteria in our own intestines. A deficiency of Folic Acid can result in: It is suspected that serious problems may result in unborne children, such as cleft palate (fissure or split in the roof of the mouth), horseshoe kidneys (union of the kidneys at the lower end), hydrocephalus (fluid within the cranium--- water on the brain), harelip, and heart and brain defects. Anemia, megaloblastic anemia (shortage of large red blood cells), and sprue (sore mouth, indigestion and diarrhea) may occur also. Individuals taking such drugs as aminopterin, streptomycin, and the sulfa drugs must be warned that these drugs DESTROY Folic Acid. Now for those who need or think they need Folic Acid supplements in order to meet their needs, I suggest eating foods that are known to contain Folic Acid. That way, you will be assured of getting the highest quality and not some synthetic version. I don't have a list (yet) showing the amounts of Folic Acid in various foods, but I have a small list that contains abundant amounts of Folic Acid: spinach watercress greens of mustard, beet turnips, parsely, carrots, broccoli generally in almost all green leaves of vegetables and herbs mushrooms soybeans wheat germ liver milk Naturally you will be assured that you are getting Folic Acid if you eat these foods RAW (uncooked) where possible.

(The effect of Mayor Flynn's billhas yet to be seen) Most people are now not only afraidof homosexuality (probably because it's so foreign to them), but alsoof being labeled prejudiced. Like the Joe Jackson song:You don't want to sound dumb,You don't want to offend,...It seems to me that generally people would rather just avoid the wholeissue, as opposed to making an honest effort of equality. A goodindicaton of this is the media's (specifically TV shows and films)use of homosexuality. There are few series or films that deal directlywith the subject. Most of those that do are then simply ignoredby the viewing public, which in turn force the producers (greed-stricken as they are) to simply not use the subject again.One good counter-example of this you might argue, would bethe (canceled but now syndicated) series ""SOAP"". And I agree. Forawhile a gay theme was quite prominent and accepted - over caricaturedas it was (I mean, really. How many of you really dated a pro footballquarterback? Can we talk?). But Jody fell victim to society's homophobicnuerosis: after a few well timed drinks he eventually started tostraighten up. First he got Carol pregnant, then he fell in lovewith a female private investigator. And after that - for the few remainingepisodes - very little was mentioned about him being gay. The samething seemed to have happened on ""Dynasty"". I hadn't seen the seriesfor about a year and a half, until a few weeks ago. I was rathersurprised to see Steve (I think that is who it was) was now passionatelystraight. Again, I never heard any mention to his former lifestyle,so I'm left to assume that sometime during those episodes that I missedhe had found some (rather expensive probably) ""miracle cure"". Thepoint that these two series seem to show is that generally peoplewould rather just avoid the whole issue. And producers sense this;and they are not driven by any principles or moral obligations -only greed.One major film that almost made it by the public's homphobictraps was ""Victor/Victoria"". If it weren't for the off-the-wallstory, by Blake Edwards, and the great performances of the stars- Robert Preston, James Garner, Alex Carras, and Mary Poppins (oops,I mean Julie Andrews) - I think that this film might have bit thedust like ""Making Love"" did. Although much of the story dealtwith some form of sexuality, that issue for the most part was treatedon the surface very cavalier and non-chalantly. The setting first of all,was in Gay Paris. This gave the film a quaint, if not cute, ambiance.Like with Robert Preston and Alex Carras sitting in bed together,elegantly sipping coffee (or whatever), and of course both of theirpinkies' were extended to the proper angle. This caricaturing actuallymade the film more bearable; people weren't turned off so much by thegay theme, and were able to enjoy the story. Actually, the storywas nothing more than a Shakespearean comedy. All the characters fumbledaround, finding themselves in bizarre, tangled situations. When atthe final moment, when all seems lost, in flies Puck, that mischeviousfaerie, who magically unravels their dilemma and everyone liveshappily ever after at the end.Well, anyways, I just thought I'd drivel for awhile.

I foundMike Simpson's analogies with civil-rights laws and the following backlashagainst blacks on the part of whites a little short-sighted, for it wasthese very laws which catalyzed the courts to drag the rest of Americansociety into the 20th century and began to change the attitudes of mostordinary Americans. In the same way, anti-discrimination laws and policiesprotecting gay people *may* lead to some increase in harassment (I amnot convinced of this) but we should not concern ourselves with the short-termfallout.On a mildly related issue, I have always wanted to have the chance toflame against the San Francisco ordinance which would have extendedthe city benefits to spouses of city workers to co-habitants, meaningespecially, though not exclusively, to gay man and lesbian couples.It was rightfully defeated, but I was disappointed at the outrage thatit caused. Think of the legal morass it would have generated, as one triedto define who was deserving and who wasn't. There may be many argumentsagainst marriage in many people's minds, but from a legal point of view,one thing is very clear--either you is married or you ain't. Marriageendows the couple with a set of rights and responsibilities which can belegally enforced. Cohabitation exists at the whim of the parties involved.Of course, this leaves gay people on the outside as far as this kindof protection goes. My point is that a bad ordinance isn't going tosolve much of anything. Better to work for some kind of legal recognitionfor gay couples--one hesitates to call it ""marriage"" because of all ofthe psychosociological drek that comes with that word, but an equivalentto ""marriage"" is what is required.

Milder than most anti-gay statements that one usuallycomes across in mass culture products. The statement occurs towards the endof the movie. I won't say much. But basically, this guy is in the shower.He hears a noise and thinks it's his friend. He says something like ""Howie,is that you?"" Howie doesn't respond. He says something like ""Hey, Howie, Idropped my soap. Wanna Bend Over and pick it up? <chuckle, chuckle>"" I neverhave liked that joke. Never. In fact, I never really thought it was funny.Soon after the kid in the shower says this he gets what he deserves.I was glad.I thought it was interesting that the guy in the shower would say this to Howie.He said it because Howie wasn't responding. I got the impression that he saidit as a 'last resort.' The implication being that, if you don't want to bemistaken for gay, you respond to statements like that. If you don't, you canget shit for being gay. No one wants that. Hence the kid in the shower knewthat if it was Howie out there, he would respond to *that*. (or else appearuncomfortably silent)Hey, while were on the topic of mildly oppressive taunts I'd like to ask astrange question. What kinds of anti-gay socializing experiences did you gothrough as a kid in school? For Example: what did it mean when someone wouldshake your hand with their middle finger folded in. Do You Know What I Mean?I always found that VERY disturbing as a kid. It was like ""what is thisperson doing, how am I supposed to react."" Also, I vaguely new that it hadsomething to do with being an outcast. I kinda knew that it didn't reallymatter how you responded but that the chief thing was that you weren't supposedto let it throw you off kilter. If it was the kind of thing that you hadtrouble dealing with, you were dead meat. It wasn't the kind of thing thatyour friends did to you. But then again, 3rd grade friends are pretty differentfrom 12th grade relationships. Does Anyone Else Remember This? I get theimpression that these are the kinds of things that I (being gay) would be MOSTlikely to repress. It's not a pleasant memory. I only mention it in the hopesthat someone else out there will remember something even more disturbing so thatI can go ""Oh yeah, I guess I remember that. WOW, I haven't thought of thatsince I was a kid. And no wonder! It gives me the creeps even NOW, just tothink about it.""It makes me think of this story a friend told me. One year a somewhat popularkid in my friend's high school went around telling people he was gay. He got afew other people to say ""Oh yeah! oh really? you know what, I'm gay too."" Atwhich point the somewhat popular kid would reveal that he was just out to makefools out of all the faggots. ""Ha Ha! Sucker, you fell for it, now everyone'sgonna know that you're gay."" If I'd been in high school with that somewhatpopular kid I would of spent every ounce of creative energy towards subtlydegrading that guys quality of life. That guy would've been the one personwhom I could've *truly* hated.Does all this stuff fall under the heading of Gay-Baiting? And while were onthe topic, what IS gay-bait, huh? Is it a cop who hangs out in parks waitingto arrest 'loitering' gays? Is it a straight guy (yeah! uh, huh, right.) whogoes to a gay bar to pick up some unsuspecting ""queer"" so that he can take himhome and beat him up? WHAT IS IT? I apologize if this discussion increasesthe general paranoia of our closeted brethren. My intention is to elucidate,not to frighten. Anyway, I get the impression (I've been getting a LOT ofimpressions these past few minutes) that these are the kinds of questionsthat truly closeted people are just dying to ask, but of course, since they'retruly closted, there's noone to ask.All you verbal netters: Don't leave me out in the field with this one --Venture a reaction, at worst you'll be ignored.Another Trauma In The Playground fromRobert DeBenedictisdecvax!yale-comix!debenedi",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/pznZtqUPA3I/m/dROLzU-n_7cJ,,,

The article dealt with the banning of public sex at San Francisco's bathhouses. One point that was brought up was `where does such legislation stop?'. The measure was meant to reduce the spread of AIDS by ""eliminating???"" anonymous sex among gay males. There seems to be many people on both sides of this argument, and I would like to be included in the group against this law. Agreed, the spread of AIDS is bad, but the passage of such laws are equally bad for the gay movement. I am NOT saying that I am for public sex or agreeing that such behavior is okay. Actually, I have no strong feelings for or against it. What I *AM* wondering about is; was this law passed in the name of preventing the spread of disease or simply a way of eliminating a rather icky practice. Can such laws really reduce the number of anonymous sexual encounters? It was always my understanding that many such encounters could at least start in any public place and then finish in private. Right? Gays crusing in bars are usually looking for 'a good time' and not merely looking to get drunk. A logical progression would be to close down ALL places where gays could meet with the hopes of picking someone up for sex. I don't think this last statement is too far off the mark, given many of the statements I've seen by your friend and mine, the Rev. Jerry Falwell.

(Although, on the other hand, I do not think that sex should be practiced in public places like parks, the bathroom at Macy's, etc.) Part of the reason for bathhouses was to remove a large quanity of public sex to ""private"" places that allowed the persons involved to meet in somewhat more dignity than the parks provide. Also, I still remember bathhouse raids in days of yore, when police ran hundreds of nearly naked men out into the streets to be arrested and harassed. I do not not wish to go back to the past. We need to get far more organized to prevent this kind of thing in the future. Also, we need to fight AIDS on the level where it will do some good, i.e. in the medical labs, rather than having to deal with these shortsighted and damaging ""solutions"".

My site dousn't send notes out of the building,but we can get out with mail. If you can, Thanks.)I have been reading this group for about 2 months now buthave never posted to it before. There are two reasons fortis. The first is that this site doesn't send notes off-site.The other reason is that after reading for a while I quiteoften want to flame. Due to several notes I've read recently,and the request for new voices, I'm going to put my 2 centsworth on the wire.One of the postings which has prompted me to write this is thefollowing from irish:> Nobody seems to mind that I enjoy Rush, Beethoven, and even Journey.> ""And I'm addicted to Dallas""! So what?! So why should anyone care> about my sexual preferences?I find this insulting and extremely insensitive. The Sumpreme Courtrefused this week to review a ruling by a Circuit Court in New Orleansupholding the INS decission to refuse citizenship to a gay residentalien from the UK on the grounds that he lied about having apsychopathic personality. Although he was never asked whether he washomosexual, he should have know that this fact meant that he was indeeda psychopath. The author of an article recently published inPsychology Today, and reprinted in major newspapers throughout the US,states that ""statistics and descriptions only confirm the belief heldby many heterosexuals that homosexuals are depraved"". Public officialsin San Francisco are buisily trying to determine what form ofbehavior mod will best save homosexuals from thenselves.Drawing alalogies between people subjected to such opression andpeople who like particular musicians and TV programs is to makelight of a very serious subject. Gayness is something that mostgay people perceive as a basic facet of ourselves for our entirelife. It is not a whimsical matter of taste, like prefering red-headsor Sunday afternoons. I don't care what anybody's sexual preferencesare (except my lover's), but for my entire life I have been subjectedto labelling, descrimination, and negative conditioning because ofmy sexual orientation.Quite often I have read in this group about *sexual preference* andgay people *choosing* to be gay. I would like to ask the heterosexualson the net when and how they *chose* to be straight. According tostudies and personal experience the main thing that gay peoplechoose is how open to be about our orientation with ourselvesand others. Since heterosexuality is the only accepted orientation inthis society, heterosexuals have no similar experience. It is rathershallow minded to assume out of the lack of this experience thatgay people have chosen to be *different*.The difference between sexual preference and sexual orientationis a large one. Sexual orientation is the terminology currently usedby most gay organizations, writings, and legislation. It implies notonly the understanding that gayness is an essential part of the experienceof most gay people, but it implies the same type of respect exibited byreferring to black people as black instead of colored.Another statement which disturbs me is the following from crane:> I don't know why many people who contribute to this newsgroup seem to be so> hung up about whether or not somebody is gay or bi admits it or not or> whether or not they are told that this or this person is or is not gay or> bi or whatever or even whether somebody is homophobic or not.If discussing who we are and how we [don't] fit into this societyaren't things worth discussing, I would like to know what thingsgay people should discuss? Ballet and interior design?When I first learned about this group I was very excited at theprospect of hearing from gay computers users throughout UNIXland.What I often feel after reading it is more akin to having seenanother Sunday tour bus gawking its way through the Castro:That I have again been subjected to the patronising liberalismof *slumming* straights.Keith Keilmanucbvax!hpda!keilman",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/pcP8MfE8m3g/m/cHDzNex7nNMJ,,,

When I responded on thisissue I used affectional preference which should have been affectionalorientation.For heterosexuals who consider sexual orientation to be a private matterthink about the following:WHAT IF 90% of the population were homosexual and 10% was heterosexualYour spouse dies and you are in mourning. You can't take thedays off that your company provides for these situations becausethey didn't know you were married. After all you could have lostyour job if they found out. You also cannot receive the supportand sympathy of your coworkers because they might freak out ifthey knew you were married. After all isn't that a sin.Plus if there's no will then you will not inherit and often willnot be recognized by your spouses parents.You are walking down the street or in a movie theater and youwant to hold hands with your motos date and you feel that wouldnot be safe. After all you might be beaten up by some homosexualperson who thinks you are sick, too blatant, etc.You are continually bombarded with advertising, literature, movies,TV, and other people who assume homosexuality is the norm andheterosexuality does not exist. You begin to wonder if you existand maybe you're the only one.(That's all the examples I have time for, I'm sure you can think of others)Awareness is how situations change not by pretending they don't exist.I'm always trying to raise my awareness about issues in many areas and thepeople who come up with the insights are usually the ones who live withthem everyday.

I'm sorry if I offended anyone with myignorance.About the Supreme's Court refusal to hear the case about the gay personwho was refused citizenship: I was shocked. I am quickly losing faithin the government's promise of ""equality for all"". If I thought itwould do any good at all, I'd personally bash in the faces of thoseresponsible.Keith, you seem to have misunderstood the intention of my article. Idid not mean to ""make light"" of the problems of gays with my analogiesbetween them and someone who likes certain TV shows and musicians.The point I was (and am) trying to make is that sexual orientation(see! I'm learning!) SHOULDN'T make any more difference in how aperson is perceived than what music he or she listens to. It's verydisturbing to me that it DOES. Aside from the spread of AIDS (Hey,the Haitians are all right... Let's blame the homosexuals for it!)and the dictates of some ancient book (many parts of which I stronglydisagree with), what reason is there for such discrimination? Cananyone fill me in there?(Oh, God... Don't get me wrong about what I just said about AIDS.The general public is SCARED of the disease, and ""it's all becauseof those damned queers"". It's too bad we can't give everyone avaccination against ignorance. I thought Archie Bunker was a greatcomedic character. Now, I'm saddened at how many real-life ArchiesI know.)I fully understand the lack of choice in whether to be gay or not.I didn't ask to have brown hair and brown eyes, I just turned outthat way. I don't believe I made a conscious choice when I realizedthat Beethoven and The Monkees were my favorite ""groups"" when I wasin high school (note: this was 1976), but I knew their music hadsomething in it that satisfied me. And I stood my ground when theother 10th graders teased me. I realize this ""analogy"" may bepushing it somewhat. I could have (not too easily) broken all ofmy records and sworn never to utter the names ""Ludwig"" or ""MikeNesmith"" ever again, but there would have been something inside ofme that was pushing to get out.Not understanding oppression? In my high school, there were twogroups: the ""smart kids"" and the ""burnouts"". I was caught in themiddle. The smarts ones didn't want me around because I did drugs.The burnouts didn't want me because I was too smart. I reallydidn't have any friends until I went to college. Try going throughthose so-important high school years with nothing but strangelooks and being ignored. Anyway, if homosexuality were the norm,I doubt that I would hesitate to proclaim my heterosexuality, whetherit would mean oppression or not. I am who I am, no one else.(BTW, Joe was the president of the class ahead of me. He was verywell liked during high school. A few years ago, he was arrestedfor ""making out in his car with an underaged male"". The reactionfrom a girl I know who was a member of that class was, ""Oh, no!Who's going to plan next year's reunion now that Joe is gay?"")This is getting sort of long, and I realize that my writing styleis kind of choppy. I don't admit to knowing every facet of whatgay rights entail, but what I do know of, I back 100%. I am nottrying to make light of any concerns of the homosexual population.Discrimination based on sexual orientation is as stupid as thatbased on skin color, hair color, or how many trees one has in hisback yard.Keith, I'm sorry that I offended you. It was not my intention. I'dlike to hear from you sometime via mail.

We areoften categorized as super techie nerds who wear glasses and carry hexcalculators around on our belts. They say we can't write coherent Englishand should never be let out of our cubicles except under leash and muzzle,etc.Pretty ridiculous isn't it? I stretched the truth above to make a point.But there is also some truth. However, I'm not aware of any net groupwhere people do nothing but moan and groan about how unfair society is tothem because they are programmers.There are other interest groups on the net as well. The people in thosegroups like to discuss the joys and pitfalls of C, UNIX, nude underwaterunisex backpacking or whatever. Net.religionists get off on flaming eachother. (I finally wised up and got out of that mess.) Net.flamers get offon flaming, pure and simple. Again, nobody sits around bitching about howtough life has been to them because of some proclivity in their makeupwhich causes them to take an avid interest in whatever.Then we come to net.motss. I realize that this is MORE than an INTERESTgroup. The word ""interest"" implies something casual, like somebody saidtaste in classical music, etc. I also agree that its MORE than a choice.Its something a person apparently is born with. We aren't even justtalking about sexual preference. Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to youthat we are talking about very fundamental attributes of a person'spersonality -- all of the above plus how the person views the world, theperson's perception of what is beautiful or ugly, their perceptions ofhuman relationships. No, I'm not talking about a Sunday afternoon jauntthrough the Castro, I'm talking about paying the deposit and moving in,lock, stock, and barrel.I had a roomate who once counseled me about a very tempestuous relationshipI was having: ""You gotta take the shit along with the sugar"". I realizethat the gay life is very hard. If anybody thinks a person CHOOSES to begay, guess again. It is very nice sometimes, but it can be hell. I won'tdiscount the fact that there are bigoted creeps running around condemningeverything they don't understand in the name of science, religion,parenthood, and everything in between. It is tough growing up gay. It istough comming out to yourself, it is tough living with yourself, it istough dealing with people who don't understand. Socienty CAN beoppressive. I grant all of you all of that.How does one effectively combat that? Certainly not, I hope, by being justas oppressive right back. We have to stick together as a community. Weneed this news group among other things. However, what unites us? Whatholds us together? Holding a collective chip on our collective shouldersand waiting for somebody or some group to knock it off? Why not somethingpositive instead? It's easy to tell what a lot of the Gay community isagainst, but what are they for? What does the Gay community have to offerthe straight world besides protests and outrageous and alienating behavior?I don't think we necessarily need to discuss ballet and cooking. But Idon't think a steady diet of politics, protests, and boo hooing aboutunfair other people are is too digestible either.I think it's time to come down off the cross and STOP BEING VICTIMS andstart LIVING as human beings. Lets discuss the Gay perception of life.Lets start building or pointing to some role models that many people sayare lacking among gay people. Accenting the positive aspects of life isNOT pretending that the negative one don't exist.It's back to looking at the rose or the thorn. Is the glass halfempty or half full?

Since I'm having trouble remembering how many ofthese I've been to, impression of growth is also hazy; I'm no good at judgingcrowd size either, especially when I was spending so much time in happy sensoryoverload from looking at all of *us* in all our beauty and energy--but it wasmassive and impressive once again. And once again, it felt like it was equalnumbers of women and men, a togetherness that joys my heart.Things I was glad to notice: new banners not seen in previous years, especiallyfrom neighborhood groups like Jamaica Plain and Dorchester. We are surfacingeverywhere! Who knows--we may even have banners announcing South Boston andRoxbury next year--if you live there, go for it, people! There was a ""gay,proud, and sober"" banner, a nice big one; I am proud of my brothers and sisterswho are recovering from alcoholism and addiction, and of their willingness tostand up and be seen.Other interesting presences: NOW Lesbian subgroup (a ground-breaker,considering NOW's rocky history with tolerance of its lesbiancontingent). Bisexual women's banner (another groundbreaker--I have seen a lotof suspicion of bisexuals in the gay community, privately and in the letterspage of GCN. I'd also seen in GCN some announcements of bi women gettingtogether and saying NOW WAIT A MINUTE, and so was glad of their presence. Roomfor everyone, folks!) Harvard/Radcliffe gay/lesbian banner (with slogan""Veritas--it's true""! My only regrets are that I graduated before the groupwent public in a big way, and before I came out!) Rainbow Coalition--apparentlyaligned with Jesse Jackson, but representing a split in Mel King's RainbowCoalition, according to one of their number. She said some of King's supportersare working through the Democratic party organization, but the group there atthe march represented a movement to form an independent anti-fascist partydrawing from the Rainbow's constituent groups. Saw no other national politicalparty-type presence, although the gay political action groups were veryvisible.And the noble folks in the AIDS campaign. They stood at the entrance of BostonCommon, each holding a sign with a simple day and date, leaving it unsaid thatsomeone died on that date. I felt the Shade touch me as I passed, and it wasonly right; we sure need our celebrations, but we just as surely need toremember the (literally) deadly serious stuff.This year, the rally on Boston Common had access limited by fences set up,apparently, by the organizers; you were asked for a dollar contribution by amarch organizer as you entered. As I had a dollar, I did not witness if peoplewere nice to those of us who did not have a dollar. I surely hope that was thecase. In this vocal community, I expect to hear loud protest if it were not. Ihad mixed feelings about the fences: not about the collection of donations, asI know what a cash-flow nightmare it is to do things like this. Rather, Iremember how each year there'd be incidents with queer-bashers harrassing thefringes of the rally, and feel sorry that we need a fence. But then, I'm onlyassuming that was one of its purposes. Does anyone involved with the organizershave the scoop?I did not watch much of the rally itself; heard some wonderful music byCasselberry and Dupree (sp?) who were just as great as when I'd first heardthem at the Michigan Women's Music Festival. They were promoting a concert theywere doing that night for a women-of-color organization called WOZA. AnnMcGuire (the new mayoral liason to the gay/lesbian community, for those of younot following Boston politics) was just starting to read from a fistful ofnotes as I was leaving.General impression: people having a good time enjoying a beloved tradition. Notmuch slogan-chanting, lots more cheering and dancing in the street. To me, thisis fine; it felt like we're out of the chronic anger stage and into a morematter-of-fact ""Why, of course we have the right to be here, and of course it'simportant!"" Which, to my mind, is a hell of a lot harder attitude forhomophobes to sneer at, not to mention a lot easier attitude for us tomaintain for the long pull.

Moral issuescannot be reduced to a matter of mental health. The way I see it homosexualpractice is largely a moral issue. I just don't understand how the contentionthat homosexuals are born--not made--is really supported by scientific data.It is certainly not in the same category with the evidence that women orblacks are born and not made. Has science demonstrated that sexual preferenceis in our genes? I don't think so. (The idea seems really weird sincethe gene would have to be transmitted by heterosexual practice.) Yet fromwhat I have seen the Gay Rights Movement is trying to place the sexualpreference in the same boat with women's rights and racial discriminationissues. When they do this they go beyond claiming the right to believingin, and practicing, homosexuality; they claim the right to impose on othersthe belief that homosexuality is right. Not only will a dissenting opinionnot hold, it will be actively supressed (e.g. by including it in theAffirmative Action agenda).It seems to me that what social science has shown is that each individualhas the capacity to develop in a variety of ways concerning their sexualpreference. I can even accept the notion that the individual makeupof some may bias them toward developing one preferance over the other.But demonstrating the possibility of such bias through psychology, orwhatever, does not answer the moral question of whether or not homosexualpractice is right, or whether the sexual tendencies in theseindividuals are indelible (like their gender or race would be). It seemsto me that the same sociological evidence that would give intrinsicrights to homosexuals would also give them to those who claim to havebeen born with pedophilic tendancies. Should we honor their sexualbehaviour with consenting minors? (This may not be far off. There isa group (name escapes me now) that is actively trying to influencethe sex education cirriculum in the public schools. Thier motto is,""Sex before eight, or it's too late"". -- Not with my kid you don't.)It seems to me that the sexual preference issue is going to get pulleddown to the young child's level along with the increasing pressure beingput on children to make decisions about sexual activity in general. Ifsexual preference is largely a learned moral behaviour (rather than agenetically determined condition) then kids will learn that ""anything goes""as far as sex is concerned long before they have the capacity to dealwith, or even assess, the consequences of their decisions.I've seen the reasoning used here that the fact that there are ""repentant""homosexuals only goes to prove that those individuals were not naturalhomosexuals. That does'nt make sense to me. Good scientific theoremsneed to have some predictive value. You don't get that from making posthoc assumptions. On what basis can the sexual preference of an individualbe predicted, or even determined at the earliest stages of their development?I'll probably be sorry I posted this.

Since all you heterosexualsout there seem to be asking homosexuals to justify the fact that they arenot bad, I'd like to turn the question back to you. What makes you thinkthat you can put yourself in a position of righteousness and demand ofothers that they justify their preferences without you ever justifying yours.You make an analogy between pedophilia and homosexuality. I will answer yourquestion on why I think pedophilia is bad. First of all, pedophilia is thewrong word. pedophilia means loving children. I don't see what could bewrong with that if the children are willing throughout but it is very hardto know if they are willing or not. When one thinks of pedophilia one isusually thinking of rape as ""incest"" also seems to have taken on the meaningof rape by a member of one's immediate family when actually all it means issexual relationship between members of the same family. Anyway when childrenare involved it is very hard to determine the degree of willingness of thechild as the adult is more powerful than the child most often (no matter whatcertain authors would like people to believe). That is why I think pedophiliaincestuous or not, is dangerous: it leaves the door open to a lot of abuseas the two participants are not of equal strength. (Actually an analogy betweenpedophilia and heterosexuality would make much more sense, as partners inheterosexual relationships are often of unequal strength, which leaves thedoor open to a lot of abuse - and many people do go through that door)Homosexuality is different (even though some people like to lump themtogether for shock effect). The homosexuality being discussed here isbetween consenting adults. It is a cliche, but is the main point of it.Why is it ""wrong"" for two consenting adults of the same sex to havesexual relationships? why not? since you are claiming that it isn't,the onus is on you to prove that it isn't. The position of homosexualson the net have been so far, that it is not right or wrong either way,i.e they are not putting a moral judgement on the act. So why are you?explain yourself, tell us what you base your moral judgement on in thefirst place, so that we don't get into pointless discussions.

But it seems to methat this one is the crux of the matter, and the stumbling block for manypeople who label themselves Christian.

Really not. In fact it sounds just a bitbizarre to me. Sort of like ""eating oysters is largely a moral issue.""Human relations (of any sort) are grounded in the moral arena, but what isso special about homosexual acts in and of themselves which entitles themto being singled out for moral notice? It seems to me that there is onlyone reason for this attitude, namely, the misinterpretation of the Genesisand Levitical texts and some of the Pauline letters adopted over the last700 years by the Christian Church. At least one knows where such peopleare coming from: it's just a variant of ""the Bible says so, so it's true.""Now, such people don't cotton well to being told about the subtleties ofthe texts, and the contexts in which they appear, nor do they bother tocarry forth other Scriptural proscriptions against certain behaviors. Ialways liked the one about it being easier for a camel to pass through aneye of a needle than a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Oh--youmean that wasn't REALLY what was being said. You mean I need to understandthe CONTEXT of Christ's teachings. Uh-huh.Anyway, I want to know whether those Christians who feel, as Paul Dubuc does,that homosexuality is a ""moral"" issue, feel that the moral argument liesentirely upon what you perceive Scripture to be saying. That is, becauseyou read the Bible as condemning such actions, homosexuality there, andthere alone, takes upon itself a moral dimension. In that case, how doyou deal with a pluralistic, secular society which is not Bible-based?What right do you have to enforce your conceptions of morality upon thosemembers of society who do not share your reading of Scripture?And if you feel that there is more to morality and homosexuality thansimply the meagre, disputable allusions in the Bible, then by all meansstate it! I have never once heard an argument ""against"" homosexualitythat did not collapse under scrutiny, and which was not ultimatelyfounded upon misinformation about gay people or questionable assumptions.As many of the readers will undoubtedly point out, this discussion isnot really necessary, since gay people will continue to exist quite happilywhether or not they receive the approbation of the Fundamentalistreligionists. I am doing this more as a favor to them, so that theycan get their opinions stated clearly once and for all here.

After all, in the course of alifelong marriage, a couple would probably have intercourse thousands oftimes, but only a very small percentage of those times would be with theintention of conception; the rest would be for the fun and joy and communionof it.---- Jeff Sargent{allegra|decvax|harpo|ihnp4|seismo|ucbvax}!pur-ee!pucc-h:aeq""...got to find my corner of the sky.""",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/o3huWFV6cms/m/wFO8ldnT2Q0J,,,

Foolish mortals, they don't know what they are missing. Asto sex involving a tremendous degree of closeness or giving of oneself, itCAN, but it doesn't neccessarily have to. I think it depends on what wedefine our terms as. I find it hard to believe that one night standsinvolve significant amounts of giving of oneself or sharing. They aremostly exercises (*pun somewhat intended*) in reminding you that you shouldhave changed your sheets. Personal comment time: I AM sexually aroused bycuddling with women (I'll leave off the word attractive for now-- beauty isvery much in the eye of the beholder and I'm sure I'd be misinterpretedotherwise. Let's just say that anyone I'm willing to cuddle with isattractive to me regardless of what the rest of the world believes. ofcourse, when have I listened to the rest of the world???). If you haven'ttried it, Jeff, I can't recommend it highly enough... Just because I amaroused doesn't mean it gets any further simply because I've found that theeasiest way to create unwelcome/subconcious committments is to go to bedwith someone. I'll save that for the people that mean something to me.>It will be interesting to see what happens if/when some nice,>attractive woman and I do become very close...will we be able to restrain>ourselves?Of course not. Men are animals. All they think about is sex, sex, sex. Youare a man, at least from what I've heard, therefore you'll go rutting offlike a mule in heat.

I've also got this nice bridge for sale....>Chuq, it might be interesting if you elaborated on your sentence beginning>""You can be at least as close....""Hmmm.... This is, shall we say, a loaded question. I find manysituations where delving into the baser aspects of sex interrupt thegeneral flow of the situation. One of the better (but quickly failing)secrets of my life is that I love to give massage (if I were flexibleenough I'd probably never leave my cave... *sigh*). There are anynumber of people, some on the net, some off the net, who could givefirst hand appraisals of this. I'm not about to mention names because Ialso firmly believe in discretion (I have every intention of living toa ripe old age... I'd love to die at the age of 90 in the hands of ajealous husband, but I don't get involved with married women). Whilemassage can be an extremely sensual hobby it also tends to be quite relaxing.I find it a great complement to myself when I can take someone who istense and stiff as a board and put them to sleep. Sex tends to becontraindicated under these circumstances. I also run into situations whereI am interacting with a person at a very intense level and the physicalcoordination required for sex tends to throw everything out of sync. One ofthe more sensual evenings I've had in the last while was when a young ladyof my aquaintance came over for the evening, helped me polish off a bottleof wine, lit my oil lamp, and we preceded to take off our clothes and tellknock knock jokes all night.

Sorry, Mr. Arndt, but I'd rather debate the proposition: ""Given that the sky is red, prove that it's not red."" Given the premise, both arguments place me in an indefensible position, despite the fact that each has a rather absurd premise. On top of this, Arndt greets every reply with insult and ridicule. Granted he himself was greeted in several instances with insult and ridicule, but ignored in the mess were any attempts that were made to point out to Arndt just how biased and unreasonable his position is. Arndt refuses to give ground on his premises, accusses us of ""not having any answers,"" and ignores any that were presented in favor of baiting us further on the issue. Sorry again, Mr. Arndt, but your argument was well dealt with, but if you're going to refuse to deal with the responses with a certain degree of detachment, I suppose you won't really understand why. Then along comes Plunkett, who accusses us merely of throwing temper tantrums, dismisses us as a group as being defensive and petulant (among other equally bizarre generalizations) and accusses us not merely of trying to find acceptance but of proselytizing. (Gee, {Mr, Ms} Plunkett, who asked for *your* phone number?) Then, of course, despite the fact that we shouldn't throw temper tantrums, we must learn to put up with profanity from others. Gosh, okay-- we'll be good and perfect and quietly take the abuse as it comes. Now, I don't necessarily agree with Steve Dyer's suggestion concerning what ought and ought not to be discussed in this newsgroup. But the point comes when discussion on this topic is no longer fruitful--and that point was at least reached when the gay members of this group were required to argue on the grounds of invalid premises if at all, or when attempts to explain why homosexuality is valid are taken to be acts of proselytizing. Providing a forum where people might rationally discuss ideas is one thing; providing a forum for name-calling is quite another. I find it rather odd that the people who pose questions in this group seem so unwilling to listen to the answers. As for questions, Plunkett poses one about public health. Or so he says that he does; actually he uses this as another attempt to vindicate his viewpoint. So I will address both: AIDS (oh, my GOD--he said the word) is not a consequence of being gay; if it were then it would strike lesbians as well as gay men and it would not strike others who are not gay. And as an argument against homosexuality, at best it wins a temporary victory-- if that is why it's not ok to be gay, then being gay was okay before its outbreak and will be again once it is able to be effectively treated. Sorry, but I can't even grant it that; even though I'm gay I will probably not contract AIDS but will probably die in an auto accident instead; I guess that God must therefore hate the automobile because he uses it to draw so many of us into the arms of Abraham. There--a logical answer, without the hint of a temper tantrum. Now I guess I'll just have to wait and see if anyone can understand it.

Net.abortion was specifically created to isolatethe net at large from a perennial discussion which generates acrimonybut little mutual understanding. I *REFUSE* to let net.motss becomeanother net.abortion, with little substantive being argued. I am notinterested in reading apologies for or attacks against homosexualbehavior--there is very, very little there which can be discusssedrationally and intelligently.Let me turn your question around: if you want to participate in a discussionof whether gay people really want to be of the other sex, or whether theyshould be allowed basic civil rights, or whether they really ""contribute""to society as much as heterosexuals do, then by all means, start your ownmailing list. Or better yet, move it to some more appropriate place:maybe net.{sci,politics,misc,flame}. Or maybe net.singles--it seems to be aconvenient dumping ground for unfocused discussions lately.>But as for cleansing the newsgroup of all but the faithful,>good luck....The ""faithful"", of course, aren't composed only of gay people, nor wouldthey all hold the same opinion on topics discussed here. And, of course,no one can ""cleanse"" a newsgroup. If I wish to see the discussion innet.motss change its direction, all I have to work with are my words andmy power to persuade.

Now, I would like to suppose this is because suchfundamental questions are unanimously solved, for all mankind, forall time (rather like asking if breathing is really necessary in""net.life""); that it goes without saying that the correct answersare bad, unnatural.But no, this is a therapy group designed to coddle the understandableconfusions of homosexual people, and not to make matters worse forthem by actually allowing a dissenting voice to be heard. If youare going to invite ""all members"" to ""express their opinions, exchangeideas,"" then you had better expect once in a while, when someone fromthe outside world stumbles into this den, as I have, to raise somefundamental questions that may unsettle you. A little profanity isto be expected also, because homosexuals, as a rule, are tremendouslydefensive and petulant, that it is, for the perverse, a little likepoking a caged and wild animal.

With theirentry a few months ago, the gay-baiters were answered calmly and patiently,but untrue to Arndt's and the Bible's assertion that a gentle answerturneth away wrath, it only increased their fervor. The real problem hereis not individual questions, but the fact that baiters ask questions not toencourage discussion, but use them as oblique attacks against what theycannot begin to comprehend. They are not interested in intelligentreplies. Any mature person, when confronted with this level of discourse,begs out. It is a waste of time. If we are guilty of anything, it is oftoo much patience and tolerance up front.Down to specifics: a discussion of public health and sexual practicesis certainly possible, though it may try the self-control of those whocannot or will not discuss such subjects rationally.

Given the same kinds of events (health crisis) among heterosexuals the same case can be (and would be) made against promiscuous hetersexual lifestyles. In fact, some sexually related health problems ARE of epidemic proportions among the heteros. The point to be taken is however that these diseases are not seen as coming into the general population from an identifible minority. They are caused by a behavior by and large and not passed like the flu. On the other hand, homosexual vectored diseases ARE being passed without the vehicle of homosexual behavior. The purpose of this article is NOT to castigate homosexuality per se, although you all know my views, but to speak out against promiscuous sexual behavior (hetero and homo) because of the consequenses to us all. Homosexuals no less than others, need to speak out against 'bath house' sex and a lifestyle the essence of which is random, repeated, anonymous sex. As a corollary, I also seek to answer the question often expressed on this net (Motss) as to what harm do homosexuals do and what business is it of anyone what two consenting adults do. If the general public IS infected with these diseases from the homosexual community the hammer blow will fall. Remember how quickly the government moved just a short time ago against Swine Flu from such a small amount of information? First, what is a sexually promiscuous person? Kinsey guessed that the average homosexual has 1000 sexual partners in a lifetime. The Village Voice put the figure at 1600. Others (from the homosexual community) have stated that 10,000 for a ""very active"" homosexual would not be extraordinary. As a result, certain members of the homosexual community (the bath house and gay bar scene) in America's large cities are infecting and re-infecting each other with a variety of diseases. This realization is dawning upon the gay community. It was the homosexuals of San Francisco themselves who took the lead in outlawing sex in the bath houses of that city earlier this year. To quote a gay writer in the Washington Post, ""You can take away AIDS and you're still looking at a community that happens to be a diseased community. I'm sorry. The bulk of your venereal diseases now reside within the gay community. The bulk of enteric (intestinal) diseases is now within the gay community."" What Newsweek termed, ""a carefree sexual adventure, a headlong gambol on the far side of the human libido."" is turning into a nightmare for a growing number of young men and women. A 28 year old AIDS victim from New York City told Newsweek, ""The belief that was handed me was that sex was liberating and more sex was more liberating."" AIDS is a breakdown of the natural immune mechanism of the body which can no longer fight off infections we normally have no problem with. Today it is conservatively estimated that there are 4600 victims of AIDS in this country, of which 40% have already died. But the real horror comes with the following information!! It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 persons with pre-AIDS (early signs) and no one knows how many are incubating the disease. AIDS is a new disease WITH AN INCUBATION PERIOD OF UP TO FOUR YEARS!!!! Lest you think this is alarmist, hear Dr. Donald Abrams of San Francisco General Hospital quoted in Newsweek, ""(the hospital) estimates that 25% of gay men in San Francisco now have lymphadenoathy (pre-AIDS)."" IF this represents the early stage of AIDS (and there is evidence that it does and that it is infective), then, short of some dramatic behavioral change, the gay community is on self-destruct. What of the recent work of Dr. Robert Gallo and his research team at the National Institutes of Health? They recently identified a virus, HTLV-3, as a possible cause. (It may not be the only cause!) Some research physicians believe that their announcement was grossly premature spurred by, ""a private competition - for fame, prizes, new research funds."" (New York Times) But horror piles on horror, for if the virus HTLV-3 IS the cause of AIDS it has been found in 75% of patients with pre-AIDS and 35% of SYMPTOMLESS homosexuals!!!! Talk of a cure is groundless at this point in time and a vaccine is years away. Unfortunately the litany must go on. There are today incubating within the homosexual community, pandemic, rare, and exotic diseases formerly considered 'tropic' and waiting like a time bomb to explode into the general population. They are termed ""Gay Bowel Syndrome"": -Amebiasis, a disease of the colon caused by parasites. Causes dysentery and sometimes liver abscesses. Usually picked up from contaminated food. -Giardiasis, a parasitic bowel disease causing diarrhea. Spread in a similar way. -Shigellosis, a bacterial bowel disease which can cause severe dysentery. In children, can be fatal. Contaminated food is the usual cause. -Hepatitis A, a viral liver disease (less serious than B or non-A, non-B) spread by fecal contamination: e.g., food, water, and close person to person contact. GBS is a major health problem for us all because; of the rapidly expanding pool of infection in the homosexual community; the ease of spread to the wider public; the tendency for persons to be infected with one or more of these organisms at the same time; the difficultly of clinical diagnosis (they all have common symptoms); nearly all groups of GBS diseases have SYMPTOMLESS CARRIER STATES. In 1977, a fourfold to tenfold increase in GBS-type diseases was noted in San Francisco. It has gotten worse since! In NY as well. The New England Journal of Medicine reported in 1980 that in San Francisco an average of 10% of people reported as having amebiasis, giardiasis, or shigellosis were employed as food handlers. Between 60% - 70% of these persons were homosexuals. How long before the cry goes up for homosexuals to stay out of the food-handling business the way the blood banks now try to screen them out? What about bartenders, medical care facilities, teachers, day care centers, etc, etc.? We have not mentioned gonorrhea or Hepatitis B, both also epidemic among homosexuals who are promiscuous. Well enough. Again, I think the the homosexual community itself should be taking the lead in speaking out against prommiscuous behavior among their ranks as should heterosexuals be doing the same for theirs. May I suggest you look up, GAY TIMES AND DISEASES, by Patrick Buchanan and J. Gordon Muir in the American Spectator, Aug.'84 from which much of this article was taken.

Of course, ""Can any good thing come from a Lymph node?"" I didn't flame then and I'm not going to now. I couched the issue (typical homosexual sexual behavior and secondary heterosexual sexual behavior as a disease vector and public health menace, with particular attention to it's impact on the homosexual movement and goals) in terms of PROMISCUOUS sexual behavior in order to leave some room for discussion and not just come out with a blanket rejection of homosexual practices and lifestyle per se. Here is ANOTHER issue that the homosexual community MUST address and in fairly short order as the rows of AIDS victims gets longer and more noticeable in each succeeding Gay Pride march. How many wheelchairs can Sister Boom Boom push at one time, like a line of shopping carts? (Just a little gallows humor there folks. Don't get your bowels in an uproar. The homosexual community has provided much gallows humor, such as the amazing scene in the vaulted gothic chapel of Union Theological Seminary in upper Manhattan with speakers for the Gay Men's Health Crisis [see they DO know about it even if it's not in their advertising] standing below a large crucifix, graphically explaining the elements of low-risk sex and distributing phamphlets advising the assembled to ""shower with your partner as part of your foreplay to check for sores, swollen glands, etc., of which he may not be aware."" From the Am. Spectator which Ron doesn't want you to read. So I say, here is another issue (the other being, you remember, **morals**) that should be a topic of concern to ALL. There was a nice innocent repartee about what to do with the toilet seat after you were finished ( on net.women or net.flame) a while ago. Ah, for the good old days. Now the burning questions are, did you remember to paper the seat and can you exit the stall and the lav using only your elbows? Better yet can you hold it till you get home? Ron Rizzo quotes Pat Buchanan (a co-author of the Spectator article): ""Pity the poor homosexuals. For years they have violated nature and now nature is exacting a terrible revenge."" The implication being that pity is far from compassion for Pat (it MUST be since he does not support homosexual goals) and there is no case to be made about homosexual behavior being in violation of ""nature"". Well, let's look at that one for a minute. In what sense is something (anything) to be seen as ""against nature""? If I insist in jumping off buildings without a parachute is that against nature? If I cure my cold by cutting off my toes is THAT against nature? People get put away (homosexuals beware) for those behaviors. What is the result of homosexual behavior vis a vis nature??? Well, it is the contention of one leading British expert, writing in the BRITISH JOURNAL OF VENEREAL DISEASES in 1982, that the common mouth-anal contact of active homosexuals carries ""the almost inevitable risk of transfer of bowel pathogens."" Ergo the title of this posting. Even the Arabs (before they got all our money and grew grass and learned to play soccer) learned to eat only with the right hand and leave the left for dragging a handful of sand across their bums (is that why they are so cranky?) when they were done soiling the pristine glory of the dunes. The question before the house is, Is it ""natural"" to consider the lower bowel to be a sexual organ? Is it analogous to other self destructive behavior? Sure we can work for a cure, maybe even get one. Should you continue with the behavior in the mean time? And does the presence of a cure really answer the question? (you remember, the one before the house!) If I can fix up broken legs and heads does that mean that jumping is now NOT againts nature? The broken legs and heads still happen as a result of a jump. Putting your tongue(or other) up your SO's bum (male or female) still gets you a bag of germs. I realize the problem this presents for homosexuals who unlike heterosexuals have not many options left. Where DO they put things? Perhaps a giant body condom would help? See below for one private response. I won't say the name but he's a confused Icelander. ----------------------------------------------- If ( AIDS == Gods way of punishing homosexuals ) { VD = Gods way of punishing straights. } I think this hole(sic) thing is sic(sic). Why don't we just find a way to cure both AIDS and VD. It won't be easy we will have to work together both staraight and gay. Let me ask Arndt this if you had a disease would you refuse a cure if it was developed by a gay? Nuf said. -------------------------------------------------- Who said anything about God? Who is against a cure? Who wouldn't take a cure and what does who developed it have to do with ANYTHING??? See what too many chemical milk shakes will do to the old neurons? Well, enough for now.

Ergo the title of this posting. ""Nature"" is simply a word to describe the way things happen and occur ""out there"". The problem is often that some people distinguish between ""out there"" (the ""natural"" world) and us (human beings), as if what human beings did somehow was not ""natural"". ""Nature"" is not a set of rules that things follow (no punishment from a 'mother nature' or a deity for not ""obeying""), but rather a set of observations that describe how things happen. Thus the only things that are ""against nature"" are those things that don't happen. And once they do happen, they're no longer ""against nature"". > The question before the house is, Is it ""natural"" to consider the > lower bowel to be a sexual organ? Or the hand, Ken? Or the mind? By the above paragraph, clearly it is natural to do so since some of the human beings out there (part of what you call nature) do so. > Is it analogous to other self destructive behavior? The use of the word ""other"" is pretty vacuous; it immediately assumes that the behavior is self destructive while it pretends to be ""asking"" if it is. As usual, no reason is given for assuming that the implied notion is true. > Sure we can work for a cure, maybe even get one. > Should you continue with the behavior in the mean time?

There also seems to be a growing group of very goodand honest people who just don't want to have anything to do withChristianity.

Laziness and/or unintendended ignorance, I guess; it's much easier to deal with a group as a group than to separately acknowledge the various sub-groups within the group. It would be easy (to use an analogy) to say that 'Black people do this' in discussing certain behaviors that are practiced almost exclusively by Black males. Of course, this is not meant to condone the behavior you describe in any way. I am aware that the proportion of lesbian AIDS victims to male homosexual AIDS victims is very low. However, if perhaps the lesbian community were to become more visible (both to male homosexuals and to heterosexuals), then this tendency to lump the lesbian community in with the male homosexual community would decrease.

It may just be that in straight relationships men and women are much more similar, by which I mean every straight relationship involves a man and a woman.

Correct me if I am in error, but I heard some years ago that there are more male homosexuals than female ones. If true, this may also contribute to people's impressions. I must add that I, too have used ""homosexual"" in context where I felt it would be taken as referring to a male, whereas I usually refer to female homosexuals as lesbians. However, I believe that most people realize that ""homosexuality"" can describe the persuasion (I couldn't think of a better word for it, offhand) of both men and women.

Greg > > First of all, since by your own admission, you are not a straight person, > what makes you an expert on what straight people think? This is silly: because lots of them make so much noise about it. They make noise by talking, by using words, and, according to what Trish sees, the noise mostly equates ""homosexual"" with ""male"". [I think ""lesbian"" is a much nicer sounding word; I don't know, it has a nice long ""z"". And it only refers to women--kind of neat!, where ""homosexual"" can mean women or men.]{But then, I can't go around saying people should like being called something just because I like to say the word, and that's not what I'm trying to express when I say such.} Growing up, I hear a lot more taunts about male homosexuals than female homosexuals: ""lesbo"" was only a spook word to teach us we were no longer allowed to touch each other in junior high (no more running holding hands on the playground :-( ), but we'd hear a lot more of ""homo"", used not only for no-touch, but also for any boy who was behind in other aspects of development, or who didn't act down to all the tough-guy norms (and there are many more possibilities for ""defects"" and therefore name-calling here)[hey! and don't forget all those long-hair hippy males suspected by >30ers of not-macho behavior]. Perhaps since boys didn't have their own word, but girls could (and I would hear ""homo"" referred to girls too), when we get older and use the long words (and maybe not even as a taunt! :-) ) we've by now gotten ""homosexual"" tied to some sort of applies-to-men-mostly feeling. I found some lost memory, faded and listing no references, kicking around in the dust here in the cave that refers to Queen Victoria declaring that women don't do such awful (her coloring, not mine!) things, and therefore influencing legistlation against homosexuals so that it explicitly referred to not-women (==men :-)! ). Anyway, I didn't think that all straights always mean ""male"" when they say ""homosexual"". But it is interesting that this is Trish's observation, and it is worthy of thought that homosexual women find this aggravating. We can think about our hidden context next time we say ""homosexual"".

It's related to the notion that men is *supposed* to mean ""men"" and/or ""men and women"", that he is *supposed* to mean ""he/she"" on occasion, etc. The linguistic purists will be quick to claim that using masculine words as pseudo-neutral nouns and pronouns is an accepted part of English language. Yet one can see the results of this. Since ""he"", when used to mean ""he or she"" (unknown third person neutral), is often thought by the listener to mean just what the word implies (""he"", a third person male), androcentric assumptions abound when other words (like ""homosexual"") are heard by such listeners. Naturally (?) they assume the speaker is talking about male homosexuals, or else the speaker would have specifically said ""female homosexuals"", right? (""Assume the speaker means male if no gender is specified."") This is why many people push for job descriptions free of gender bias (fireFIGHTER, police OFFICER, instead of fireMAN, policeMAN), precisely to avoid having people assume that they refer to males. Insisting that ""a policeman can be a woman"" doesn't hold much water if people interpret the word (even subconsciously) to mean policeMAN. Notice that even a word like homosexual (which one would think is neutral in gender implication content) gets interpreted to mean ""male homosexual"". (Thus it may not be just in particular words like ""fireman"", but in ingrained conditioned assumptions that if no gender is specified, we're talking about males.) Also, of course, there are other factors. (Like assuming that the words homosexual and lesbian are mutually exclusive. I seem to remember that a lot of homosexual organizations refer to themselves as the ""Gay & Lesbian ..."" specifically to make sure that lesbians are included.) But if you think about it, it all boils down to large groups of people assuming that if you say a word that may not even have ANY gender implication, you're implying ""males"". -- WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

Unfortunately, we aren't blessed with a society whose parents might consider that their children might not be heterosexual. From my experience, children on this planet tend to be taught to grow up, get married and (maybe) have children of their own. Since some of the children who are so indoctrinated are gay, it makes sense that they would have a pretty good handle on how straights think. As for straights thinking of men only when considering homosexuals, I suspect that original writer may be right. Ask any ten friends of what they picture a homosexual to look like. The odds are against it being a pretty woman, and the odds are for someone who wears leather, or abuses small children, or someone who may be a transvestite. Even when various cities have their Gay/Lesbian pride celebrations, few women are seen. Perhaps if lesbians were more visible to the outside world, they might become part of the stereotype (if, indeed, this is desirable). NAME: Henry C.

I am not criticizing them;to each his own. If they want to act that way, that is their problem.But that is not the point of this article.Another reason for people thinking only of males when they discusshomosexuals is the fact that females have traditionally been allowed tobe ""closer"" to each other. People think nothing of seeing two womenholding hands, kissing (within reason), and just generally beingaffectionate. Therefore, people usually don't even think of women asbeing gay, because even straight women are ""allowed"" to be ""close"".If men were to act the way (even straight) women do, they woulddefinitely be subject to much criticism. I guess many homosexualmales do act this way (as I mentioned in the first part of this article),which is why people do criticize them and associate homosexuality withthem.

Get my point?It's related to the notion that men is *supposed* to mean ""men"" and/or ""men andwomen"", that he is *supposed* to mean ""he/she"" on occasion, etc. Thelinguistic purists will be quick to claim that using masculine words aspseudo-neutral nouns and pronouns is an accepted part of English language.Yet one can see the results of this. Since ""he"", when used to mean ""he or she""(unknown third person neutral), is often thought by the listener to mean justwhat the word implies (""he"", a third person male), androcentric assumptionsabound when other words (like ""homosexual"") are heard by such listeners.Naturally (?) they assume the speaker is talking about male homosexuals, orelse the speaker would have specifically said ""female homosexuals"", right?(""Assume the speaker means male if no gender is specified."") This is whymany people push for job descriptions free of gender bias (fireFIGHTER,police OFFICER, instead of fireMAN, policeMAN), precisely to avoid havingpeople assume that they refer to males. Insisting that ""a policeman canbe a woman"" doesn't hold much water if people interpret the word (evensubconsciously) to mean policeMAN. Notice that even a word like homosexual(which one would think is neutral in gender implication content) getsinterpreted to mean ""male homosexual"". (Thus it may not be just inparticular words like ""fireman"", but in ingrained conditioned assumptions thatif no gender is specified, we're talking about males.)Also, of course, there are other factors. (Like assuming that the wordshomosexual and lesbian are mutually exclusive. I seem to remember that alot of homosexual organizations refer to themselves as the ""Gay & Lesbian ...""specifically to make sure that lesbians are included.) But if you think aboutit, it all boils down to large groups of people assuming that if you say aword that may not even have ANY gender implication, you're implying ""males"".--WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

Destruction offruitful discussion is easy if you can appear well-intentioned. Indeed,both may be quite well-intentioned, but our ability to carry on extendeddiscussion of cultural and political issues has been muddied substantially.Under these conditions, the first task is to recognise the goals and theproblems. The goals are simple: To discuss cultural and political issuesof relevance to gays. The goals do not include incessant defense of gaylifestyles or preferences. I have to defend my preference everyday ineveryday life. I refuse to do that here. Its an absolute waste of my time,and yours.The problems are, likewise, quite simple: Distraction from the goals ofthe group can be accomplished readily in a no-discipline environment. Wehave no moderator. No one can intercede against one member for the overallbenefit of the group. I.e., no one can stop Ken from flaming and no onecan stop you from responding.WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?1. STOP DEFENDING YOURSELF IN SITUATIONS WHERE DEFENSE HAS NO EFFECT.You know, and I know that Ken won't change his mind. With that in mind,who do you think you are helping by flaming back at him? You aren'thelping the overall group, certainly. Most of us are gay. We already knowthat gays are OK.The person you are helping is Ken. He WANTS you to respond. There aremany possible reasons for that, but sincere interest on his part is hardlyone of them.You might be helping yourself, by getting something off your chest.Please, before you get something off your chest: THINK. Are you doingsomething constructive ... or is it destructive? Are you destroying theunity of the group for your own relief?2. START DISCUSSING RELEVANT ISSUES.Here's some interesting ones:a. What distinguishes gay culture on the West Coast from that on theEast Coast? I bet they are pretty different. Los Angeles issubstantially different from San Francisco.b. What has been your experience in unifying gay men and lesbians inpolitical or social groups?c. Are gays becoming ""more right-wing""?d. What are your feelings about the focus of ""gay money"" in AIDS projects.The ones I know about seem to spend a lot of cash on patient support,and little or nothing on research. When the Reagan administrationrecently announced substantial cuts in the support of AIDS relatedresearch, should we be putting our money in to fill the gap? Or not?e. I liked the review of the Fourth Man. Has anyone seen Another Country?Its supposed to be a pretty good film, with a gay protagonist.f. What companies are known to have non-discrimination clauses for gays?g. Surely, you have some special interests within the gay community.

Unfortunately, we aren't blessedwith a society whose parents might consider that their children mightnot be heterosexual. From my experience, children on this planet tendto be taught to grow up, get married and (maybe) have children of theirown. Since some of the children who are so indoctrinated are gay, itmakes sense that they would have a pretty good handle on how straightsthink.As for straights thinking of men only when consideringhomosexuals, I suspect that original writer may be right. Askany ten friends of what they picture a homosexual to look like. Theodds are against it being a pretty woman, and the odds are for someonewho wears leather, or abuses small children, or someone who may be atransvestite. Even when various cities have their Gay/Lesbian pridecelebrations, few women are seen.

About West Coast/East Coast dichotomies:Just having spent a week each in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, andhaving lived on the East Coast (namely Boston) all my life, I have formed afew opinions, probably overgeneralized and unfair, but all my own, nonetheless.For me, visiting San Francisco (NOT Berkeley or the greater Bay Area) is likeliving in a gay bar, 24 hours a day. Gay men are everywhere, and an innocentappreciative glance is as likely to be returned here as it would be unnoticedelsewhere. Wonderful if you like that, but tiring to always be ""on"". I'm surelong-time residents are so used to this that they no longer notice it.Also, sexuality, even in this post-AIDS era, is MUCH more open, andmore integrated into what it means to a San Francisco Urban Gay Man.My first evening there, my host and I were walking up Market towards Castro,when he met an acquaintance, they exchanged pleasantries, and started talkinggenteely about the ""San Francisco Jacks"". I thought this was the a capellaschola of the Gay Men's Chorus for a while, until I made a remark to thateffect--turns out it's a ""jack off"" club for the carefully promiscuous.I felt a bit like a hayseed (though there's no hay in Boston.) It's not,of course, that there aren't such fraternal associations in New York orBoston, it's just that they aren't discussed in such an off-hand manner.Yet, one of the nicest, unaffected times I had there in SF was in acountry-western bar in the Folsom district called ""Rawhide."" This isUrban Cowboy country, not limited to SF for sure, and oriented towardsdancing: the Texas two-step (and three-step), the waltz, lindy, line dancesand square dancing. Men danced with men, women with women, women with men.IT DIDN'T MATTER AT ALL: people were dancing just for the enjoyment ofit. People were matched up pretty well, too. The virtuoso couples weretruly fantastic, but they didn't diminish the enjoyment of us beginners.Sexuality seemed to take a back seat on the dance floor. (Was that amixed metaphor?)LA is hard to categorize, simply because it's so spread out, and I sawso little of it. My lover and I were staying with a couple who had metback in Cambridge, and who were living in the Long Beach area. Theirsocial life is more ""married"", and they prefer to associate with othercouples, through Dignity, the gay Catholic organization--they weren'tmuch into bars. Regardless of whether I was in Disneyland or in SantaMonica, I felt very much a member of a minority, much like a Democrat inOrange County. One saw other gay men, but I didn't get much of a feelingof a community. I'd like to ascribe this to my particular circumstances,but I suspect the geographic isolation of communities in LA plays a partas well.Naturally, I've only given impressions of two West Coast cities, andnot of the areas in general.

Would you say that he's goading? I don't mind him though. (Never you mind.) But all that stuff about the lower intestinal tract, and bowels, and . . . Uh, all that stuff. Excuse me, but, what has that really got to do with being gay? Being gay doesn't mean you have a desire to engage in certain acts. Being gay means you like cuddling with other guys. That you really enjoy their company. Aren't there straights that engage in the acts Arndt described? I could swear I've read about stuff like that in Penthouse's FORUM. (I didn't get it, my mother did. She gave a copy to me and two college buddies to read on a long ferry ride. She only got it because she wanted to see the Miss America stuff.) Are they [the straights described in FORUM who engage in anal sex] just as bad, in Arndt's view? Being gay is not about sex; it is about love and affection. Or am I naive? Mr. Arndt stirs my emotions. It makes me defensive. I certainly hope I'm not a health risk. I take precautions. Mr. Arndt, why don't you advocate that gays take care to insure that they minimize their chance of getting AIDS? I don't see where you get off knocking the Gay Men's Health Crisis people. If you're so concerned why don't you man one of their hotlines? Not your problem, huh. Easier to criticize. Everyone takes health risks. The air quality is low today. Can I have a sip of your Pepsi? Buckle up. How do those new headphones sound? Gee, that looks good. 55 saves lives. Look both ways. Should we change the sheets? Are you gonna finish that? Don't sit so close to the TV. Boy, did you get tanned. Biological. Physical. Chemical. God Bless You! There are gay guys that choose to engage in activities which are currently very risky. Like anal sex with strangers. These gay guys don't do things like that because they are gay. They do it because they are either stupid, uninformed, or irresponsible. Or maybe lost. These things are unrelated to being gay. Being gay just has to do with whom you choose as your companion. Also, Mr Arndt, attitudes like yours only make things worse. How? Well, it goes like this. Little Johnny is either going to be straight, or be gay. There is no proven method for determining or setting this course. There is just nothing that has been shown to be effective in persuading Johnny about whom he should choose for his companion. BUT, you can have an effect on how Johnny expresses his desires. Attitudes like yours, Mr. Arndt, make Johnny feel like a real worthless piece of shit. If I were Johnny, and I met you, I wouldn't feel so hot about myself. So Johnny tries to go about expressing his desires in ways that won't cause the people he loves to suddenly hate him. I'm not saying Mr. Arndt that YOU would disown your son if you found out that he were gay. It's just that, with the attitudes you express, he would have good reason to believe that he might lose a little of your affection for him. You see, the persecution of gays is what causes gays to do the things that the persecutors see as unfavorable. If Johnny knew deep down in his heart that you wouldn't have him any other way then maybe he'd be proud to bring home the boy he met at the ice cream parlor. To see if you approved of this boy. To see how you felt about this boy maybe becoming a part of the Arndt's extended family. But no, Johnny would never bring his ice cream parlor boy home to you Mr. Arndt. In fact, if you were Johnny's dad, Johnny would never be able to really love another gay person because he would be filled with too much self-hatred. Making people hate themselves, and feel bad about themselves isn't good for anyone. Mr. Arndt, you don't make me feel good about myself. You don't make me feel good about being gay. Why do you enjoy being so mean, huh? I'm sorry, I just don't ever see the greatest good being serviced by hate. You seem to have a lot of hate Mr. Arndt. You may not think so, but ask around. Your heart certainly is not filled with love when you talk about gays. Ah, but that's not your problem & it's easier to criticize. If you want to go on making people feel real bad about themselves, then just keep doing what you've been doing Mr. Arndt. It won't drive ME into the bushes searching for a little self-affirmation of my worth. I know what you're up to. But I sympathize with Johnny who feels so ultimately unloved that he would rather risk death than face constant isolation of the soul. Mr. Arndt, it's not that I don't like hearing about AIDS. In fact I do; after all, I want to know what I can do to avoid getting it. But I don't like hearing about it from you. I don't think anyone thinks your looking out for them when you send out your warnings about AIDS. They're not even warnings, they're taunts. I'm done now. In the future I'll just 'n' over your articles unless I see the word 'love' in the subject line. You can use that as a cue to all us net.motss'ers so we'll know when you've changed your tune.

I personally feel that regarding sympathy seriously can be emotionally damaging. I would like to point out that feeling sorry for yourself does not help you in any way, it only aids to reinforce an inferiority complex. PERFECTION? No thank you. I will not allow myself to be pressured into making NO mistakes. On the contrary, I make mistakes willingly. WHY? Time. I only have a limited time in order to function as a human being. Perfection would take forever. I understand that there is a fundamental limitation to what I am able to take into account in order to make a decision, either concious or unconcious, and that the important thing is to respond. Sometimes the act of not responding and taking a chance is a bigger mistake than not doing anything at all. Too often, I think, people impose limitations on themselves based on a fear of making mistakes. These are your critics. They are very adept in pointing out your flaws and feel very safe in their actions because there is no means of comparison. They have no sense of real achievement. They can only take pride in their ability to undermine your attempts at improving yourself. YES! Learning takes time, and you will most certainly make mistakes. This includes relationships. The thing is not to be afraid of making those inevitable mistakes in your relationships. For an intelligent being, strength is not something you are born with, strength is something you must learn. Your mistakes add character. They reveal so much about the way you feel about yourself inside, and about your ability to accept yourself as a valuable human being even with all your flaws. Bored to death with flagrent demands Expression of wisdom a show of hands Waiting, hoping for other mistakes Sit and be stupid if that's what it takes I feel you should release that pressure that makes you feel as though you need somehow to attain perfection. You might even be able to enlighten your critics, and get them off their asses. There is no greater feeling in the world than a sense of accomplishment, and there is no substitute for excellence. You have to be willing to make mistakes in order to learn. You have to develop the patience with yourself that sometimes the gratification that comes from learning is not always immediate. I think you will find that those who don't have anything better to do than to pick you apart at the flaws are the underachievers. You don't have to join them, with some time, they are easily beaten. Don't let yourself be driven by fear, understand what that fear is, and face it. Take that risk. You could make a mistake, yes, but the experience will make you stronger. this message has been brought to you from the world of the living ( have you ever noticed that there is no newsgroup called net.singles.final? ) Continuing the saga of the character of development and the development of character.

""",Net.motss,"LOVE MEANS BEING ABLE TO SAY AND HEAR, ""I THINK YOU ARE WRONG.""Dear Mr. DeBenedictis:Re. your postling below I would like to take the opportunity to answerit point by point. First let me say thank you for the very fine toneof your reply. I would very much like to emulate you. The people onthis net ARE very sensitive and defensive about anyone who questionstheir lifestyle and behavior but I have been offensive in tone in thepast and I am now trying to change that.Subject: A Naive PleaPosted: Tue Aug 28 06:17:13 1984Geez. This Ken Arndt guy annoys me. Would you say that he's goading?I don't mind him though. (Never you mind.)* Thank you for not minding. I guess you could say I am goading butmy last few postings have tried to goad only in the sense of elicitinga reasoned reponse. Why exactly are you annoyed? If it is only becauseI question your position then do you really have a right to be annoyed?Or is it because I am requesting you to think through the consequencesof your beliefs and actions and you find that not to your liking?But all that stuff about the lower intestinal tract, and bowels, and . . .Uh, all that stuff.* I didn't get it from nowhere! Where do you think it came from?Excuse me, but, what has that really got to do with being gay?Being gay doesn't mean you have a desire to engage in certain acts.*Sure! I believe that. But now there's only two of us.Being gay means you like cuddling with other guys. That you reallyenjoy their company. Aren't there straights that engage in the actsArndt described? I could swear I've read about stuff like that inPenthouse's FORUM. (I didn't get it, my mother did. She gave a copyto me and two college buddies to read on a long ferry ride. She onlygot it because she wanted to see the Miss America stuff.) Are they[the straights described in FORUM who engage in anal sex] just as bad,in Arndt's view?* Indeed. Heteros do do it and I (if you read my postings carefully)said the same things about them. But again, the point is thatheteros have an alternative not available to homosexuals.(Send a stamped self-addressed envelope and I'll tell youwhat it is.)Being gay is not about sex; it is about love and affection.Or am I naive?* No, just silly. Like Steve Dyer when he talks of what happensbehind the bushes in the park between homosexuals as ""affection"".Either he has never been there or he is . . . silly too.A 1982 report by the American Medical Association's council onscientific affairs stated that ""Any person, of whatever sexualpreference, who shows a dominant pattern of frequent sexualactivity with many partners who are and will remain strangers,presents evidence of shallow, narcissistic, impersonal, oftencompulsively driven genital rather than person-oriented sexand is almost always regarded as pathological.""The movie recently mentioned on the net fills in the detailabout ""affection"" in the park.You don't sound like that kind of person, by the way.Mr. Arndt stirs my emotions. It makes me defensive. I certainly hopeI'm not a health risk. I take precautions. Mr. Arndt, why don't youadvocate that gays take care to insure that they minimize their chanceof getting AIDS? I don't see where you get off knocking the Gay Men'sHealth Crisis people. If you're so concerned why don't you man one oftheir hotlines? Not your problem, huh. Easier to criticize.* You a health risk? What about the risk to YOUR health?But I DID speak out against PROMISCUIOUS homosexual andheterosexual behavior! I invited the net to speak out aswell. The avoidance and silence is sorry to see. I wasn'tknocking the Health Crisis people per se, but the INCONGRUITYof their holding forth in a church. My speaking out here ISan expression of my concern despite the poor manner in whichI have presented my concern (jibes) and the hysterical (I don'tknow how else to express it) reaction I received.Everyone takes health risks. The air quality is low today. Can I havea sip of your Pepsi? Buckle up. How do those new headphones sound?Gee, that looks good. 55 saves lives. Look both ways. Should we changethe sheets? Are you gonna finish that? Don't sit so close to the TV.Boy, did you get tanned. Biological. Physical. Chemical. God Bless You!* So AIDS, etc. is just another health risk? Tell it to thosewho have it. Or to those who need blood transfusions!They aren't doing anything to warrant the risk they standunder!!! Your behavior places them at risk.There are gay guys that choose to engage in activities which are currentlyvery risky. Like anal sex with strangers. These gay guys don't do thingslike that because they are gay. They do it because they are either stupid,uninformed, or irresponsible. Or maybe lost. These things are unrelated tobeing gay. Being gay just has to do with whom you choose as your companion.* What about the stupid, uninformed, irresponsible non-gay menwho engage in anal sex with strangers? I mean where are they?Lost?? LOST?? You mean spiritually? Or mentally?Unrelated to being gay? There are still only two of us!Who you choose as your companion - like my dog or my gun?Also, Mr Arndt, attitudes like yours only make things worse. How? Well,it goes like this. Little Johnny is either going to be straight, or be gay.* Not according to the testimony of some of the netters!There is no proven method for determining or setting this course. There isjust nothing that has been shown to be effective in persuading Johnny aboutwhom he should choose for his companion. BUT, you can have an effect onhow Johnny expresses his desires. Attitudes like yours, Mr. Arndt, makeJohnny feel like a real worthless piece of shit. If I were Johnny, and Imet you, I wouldn't feel so hot about myself. So Johnny tries to go about* Hey, stop that! I think that you are no doubt a hell of a guy!I think you are wrong in your judgements and actions on thisissue but I can't evaluate you as a total person nor should I.That would mean I might be judged by my own standards and Iwouldn't want that. Though some people hate homosexuals Idon't. I don't like their program and what I see as selfdelusion as to what they are doing.expressing his desires in ways that won't cause the people he loves tosuddenly hate him. I'm not saying Mr. Arndt that YOU would disown your sonif you found out that he were gay. It's just that, with the attitudes youexpress, he would have good reason to believe that he might lose a little ofyour affection for him. You see, the persecution of gays is what causesgays to do the things that the persecutors see as unfavorable. If Johnnyknew deep down in his heart that you wouldn't have him any other way thenmaybe he'd be proud to bring home the boy he met at the ice cream parlor.To see if you approved of this boy. To see how you felt about this boymaybe becoming a part of the Arndt's extended family. But no, Johnnywould never bring his ice cream parlor boy home to you Mr. Arndt. In fact,if you were Johnny's dad, Johnny would never be able to really love anothergay person because he would be filled with too much self-hatred. Makingpeople hate themselves, and feel bad about themselves isn't good for anyone.* Hey, get down! This avoids the whole (main) issue of whetheror not there is a difference between being gay or being a---------(fill in the blank with something that it is wrongto be) Your statements ASSUME gay is ok and I don't buythat point. What if your son came home with other kidsbooks, etc. He's a compulsive taker! Can't help it.I have to accept that, right? Still only two of us.Mr. Arndt, you don't make me feel good about myself. You don't make me feelgood about being gay. Why do you enjoy being so mean, huh? I'm sorry, Ijust don't ever see the greatest good being serviced by hate. You seem tohave a lot of hate Mr. Arndt. You may not think so, but ask around. Yourheart certainly is not filled with love when you talk about gays. Ah, butthat's not your problem & it's easier to criticize.* Hate! Shit! You mean I don't agree with what you aredoing. My crime is that I say so and ask you to lookat what you are doing. May you never meet real hate.To you love means never saying someone else is wrong.(Except if they don't agree with you.)If you want to go on making people feel real bad about themselves, then justkeep doing what you've been doing Mr. Arndt. It won't drive ME into thebushes searching for a little self-affirmation of my worth. I know whatyou're up to. But I sympathize with Johnny who feels so ultimately unlovedthat he would rather risk death than face constant isolation of the soul.* Johnny's problem isn't that he's unloved, it's that heis acting contrary to what those who love him think isright and he won't accept anything less than that theychange their values to suit his.Mr. Arndt, it's not that I don't like hearing about AIDS. In fact I do;after all, I want to know what I can do to avoid getting it. But I don'tlike hearing about it from you. I don't think anyone thinks your lookingout for them when you send out your warnings about AIDS. They're not evenwarnings, they're taunts.* But are they facts? Come on, to oppose you is to tauntyou, to question is to hate . . . . How does one askabout what you are doing???I'm done now. In the future I'll just 'n' over your articles unless I seethe word 'love' in the subject line. You can use that as a cue to all usnet.motss'ers so we'll know when you've changed your tune.Goodbye, Mr. Arndt.

Taking all that timely and useful info on AIDS as completely true, clearly a guy who can use the word ""teleology"" in a sentence correctly should be able to distinguish some behaviors of some homosexuals from the essence of homosexuality. The fact that the causes of AIDS and homosexuality are both unknown does not make them equivalent. Can you pronounce the word ""spurious"", Ken? Good. Watch the spelling though--only one ""r"". Yet, when you cut through Arndt's homopobia, ad hominems, and wet dreams over Sophie Quigley's breasts, what's left is a surprisingly altruistic plea. Let me see if I can state it so you don't feel like putting your fist through the screen: Lots of casual sex, by members of any sex, is an epidemiologist's nightmare. Yes, ""even Pekingeses in the Ritz do it"", but whirlwind sex is perceived as the alpha and omega of gays' existence by the ever growing right wing. (I take Ken's word for that, too.) So, gays are going to get blamed for all sorts of bad things, and it will get worse as the diseases get worse and/or gays get more visible. You don't think so? There's more of a link between gays and AIDS than there was between Jews and Germany's post-WWI economy. All it takes is a little despair. Add a tablespoon of political crisis and one demagogue. Shake well. The people needs a scapegoat. Always has. So, Ken seems to be worried that the message of ""gay pride"" hasn't been focused well enough to reassure him and his friends that the pride has to do with the OK-ness of homosexuality, not casual sex. AIDS is very scary, and if it becomes salient in the straight community, a lot of fear-crazed people may come looking for a very easy answer. Ken would rather not be muttering ""I told you so"" as he hides you from a lynch mob or its all-nice-and-legal-like, first-we-try-'em-then-we- hang-'em equivalent. There is an urgency in Arndt's (and other homophobes') postings that needs to be addressed. Homosexuality is *threatening* to these people, and they'll fight it.

Simple. There are NO female homosexuals. Ok, ok, I'm kidding. But historically, many people did not believe that female homosexuality was possible (and if they did, they didn't believe that there were anywhere near the same # as male motssers). So homosexual implied maleness, simply because only males had such ""problems"". (No flame, please -- I am speaking solely on the way that Western society has tended in the last 100 years). A similar attitude prevented most people from recognizing the female alcoholic or the incestuous parent (look at how Freud insisted that his clients were fantasizing sexual abuse, instead of admitting that such things did happen in Viennese society). In all these cases, ""society"" had a view of the correct ""proper"" behavior and the correct IMPROPER (by their standards) behavior for various groups. Lesbian activity was resolutely ignored by one and all. As an extreme example of such an attitude, consider what happened when England first outlawed homosexuality. Queen Victoria was on the throne. When the law came to her for review, she is reported to have struck out the provision making female-female sex illegal, on the grounds that such a thing was clearly impossible. The law went on the books that way.... So that's why so many people think that homosexual implies male gender -- subconsciously they don't believe lesbians exist.

"" I'm not reading anything that is not in thepublic domain or there for anyone who WANTS to look it upand I even documented where it came from. At least youdon't try to deny the statements are true.Anyway, there was a rather long discussion of NAMBLA and children's rightsvery early on in net.motss, consisting of one person speaking out for totalself-determination for kids and even infants (in the large sense--this wasnot limited to ""intergenerational sexuality"", as it was genteely referredto) and most everyone else saying how bonkers that sounded to them. Idon't think there's much more to be said here.> Sorry, I didn't appear and start to grow like Topsy onmotss till after that discussion, but that's not the pointof my posting. So glad to hear that most if not all of thenetters thought it was ""bonkers"". Now who else knows youthink that? I mean who else in the ""straight"" world, becauseTHAT'S where it counts!!! IN THE MINDS OF THE STRAIGHT WORLDYOU ARE, THAT'S ARE, CONNECTED WITH THESE PEOPLE!!! TheRene Guyon Society certainly see themselves as part of thesexual rights freedom movement. It's starting to sound likea religious ""sectual"" fight!All main-stream national gay organizations that I know of explicitly tryto dissociate themselves from any such groups as NAMBLA. The key toremember here is that ""child/adult"" sex is NOT a gay rights issue, and theonly groups who seem to want to make it one are the anti-gay forces and the{_members of such groups themselves. Even in Arndt's rather lurid excerptsfrom pedophiliac literature, there is interchangeable mention of bothfemale and male children: where are the gay issues here? Why did Arndt nottake this stuff to net.kids, or perhaps to net.singles and net.social,where he could take the straight community to task for their own shamefulmembers? Naturally not, for he has no corresponding axe to grind there.One thing is clear: net.motss is not the place for this discussion.Arndt is being just a touch disingenuous when he claims not wanting to""tar"" ""homosexuals"" with this brush, rivaling Paul DuBois' rejoiner,""Why, I'm only ASKING a QUESTION.""> Document that statement! What groups have dissociated andwhere do they say so! If ""child/adult"" sex rights are not agay rights issue then why do I see children holding signsproclaiming their rights to sex with whomever they ""choose""in homosexual rights marches??? For instance in the recentmarch in San Francisco during the Democratic convention.Groups like NAMBLA and Guyon are filled with homosexuals!What the hell does North American MAN/BOY Association mean??And as you may read if you care to the Guyon people are notparticular as to the sex of the child they destroy.Yes, the quotes I presented listed hetero and homo relations,but how does the mention of both mean no gay issues in yourmind? I know tumesence clouds conscience, but in your caseit seems to cloud thinking as well.Really! Why don't I speak to others who are doing the samething! Why pick on motss. Because I am speaking to YOU!That isn't against the law yet! You act as if to questionyour ""lifestyle"" in any of its aspects is (is jerk, in caseyou don't end sentences that way on motss). In my previouspostings I mentioned heterosexual behavior and I assure youI don't condone child abuse by heterosexuals. I DO have an""axe to grind"" with them on this issue. (Guess why I don'thave an ""axe to grind"" with them otherwise, unless you considerthe physical and psychological results of promiscuousity, -the issue we are looking at is homosexual behavior and theyare not homosexual.) Anyway, you see this as picking on you.I'm sorry Steve but you really sound childish. ""I'll take myballs home if you don't play my way!"" I must say that not tolet us play with your balls is unfriendly on this net.Just as in the community at large, there is no one voice in the gaycommunity (and it is debatable that one can even speak of THE gaycommunity.) Still, I think it is safe to say that only a very smallminority supports the aims of such groups, with most people eitheragainst or indifferent.> I'm not so sure about not being able to find a focus ofinformation about the gay community. There is a nationalnetwork with a central message. Perhaps if you don'tknow about it I should document it all for you.I would agree with your second sentence. BUT MY WHOLEPOINT TO YOU IS THAT YOU ARE NOT GETTING THAT MESSAGEACROSS TO THE STRAIGHT WORLD!!! Along with things likethe health crisis in the homosexual community and itspossible outbreak into the straight world, being seen(as you are more and more with each march that includesthe children's crusade and each new interview with somebow tied balding middle aged geek slavering over fouryear olds ""with a little massage who WANT . . ."") youhomosexuals are setting yourselves up to take it in theneck (a new sensation, unlike ""fisting"" you may not like).What to do? I'm not advocating full page adds or buttons""I'm not a chickenhawk"", but the thing that started me offwas Mike B's listing this topic at the end of a number oftopics about homosexual lifestyles (HE sees it, it seems,as a homosexual issue) and I wondered in public if he reallyknew what ""chickenhawks"" really are. Don't tell me you don'tagree with Rene (he's a real person) and NAMBLA, I believeyou Steve. (Now there's two of us) I'll sit right down andwrite Jerry a letter to let him know too. Hope he believesme next time he gets all hot about your marches and all.Laugh all you want to about him, but he DOES speak formillions of people when he denounces you. And not justBaptists!!!One last comment about Arndt's feeling that his comments about AIDS andpromiscuity haven't received a response. Nope, they haven't, and it's nowonder. Actually, it would have made a fairly interesting discussion, butunfortunately Arndt wrote off all his credibility with a large majority ofnet.motss with his earlier obnoxious behavior. It's actually prettyhilarious to see the recent spate of defenses of Arndt: all the guy needsto do is put on a tie, and suddenly he becomes reconstructed in the guiseof martyr. Sorry, folks, all I have to judge him by are his words, andby my count, his recent postings haven't even BEGUN to offset his earlierbehavior. We'll see.> Big bad Arndt, keeping you all from an interestingdiscussion. There you go again, hiding your balls.""Ma he's hitting me again"" is getting a bit thin don't youthink?You're actually keeping a score on my postings? Merde!I guess this one goes on the debit side. Hilarity is thewrong response Steve, they're trying to tell you something.How many good postings do I have to make to break even?Get ahead? (By that I mean be MORE than even - I have tobe careful how I express myself on this net)Listen Steve, even you seem to be saying that you have seena change in my postings, perhaps not this one. But let meask you, how many people that you have talked to or heard ofhave changed even a little in respect to how they regardyou starting from my position?

It is much more complicated than that.Naturally one would like the ""message"" to get across to as manypeople as possible, but the gay rights movement is very youngcompared to the civil rights movement. What we see here are theearliest rumblings of a movement, one which is still not unified,and which has only begun to make the attempt to change societalattitudes, and here, mainly through small, local actions: changing theattitudes of one's neighbors comes before the attitudes of the countryat large. Net.motss is one vehicle towards this. Having gay peoplespeak out and publically affirm their identity is one vehicle towardsthis. Seeing openly gay people elected to public office (e.g. Studds,Boston city councillor David Scondras) is one vehicle toward this.As helpful as laws and ordinances can be towards ensuring equalrights, one cannot legislate attitudes.Your comment about society recognizing racial equality as an inherent""right"" is not qualitatively different from a respect for a person'ssexual and affectional preference. What you are seeing, though, areattitudes at opposite ends of the time line. A comment like yoursabout racial equality would have seemed equally outrageous, 100, 50,even 20 years ago in some parts. Changing attitudes takes time.Already the situation of gay people today is far far better than20 years ago, even with the Brunsons still in the outback.We will have come a long way when the claims of a Falwell aredismissed out of hand by people, simply because they know gaypeople and recognize the caricature which such demagogues presentas an enormous lie. Sure we aren't there yet. It will be amatter of time. In most urban centers, there is significantprogress along these lines. You might argue that such ""progress"" isillusory, and there are many more people outside the cities withmore retrograde ideas.

Theymentioned ""chickenhawks"". Had a member of the Rene Guyon Society (10,000members in the U.S.) who came right out and SAID what they say in theirliterature! They have a RIGHT to our kids!!!!!! WE are wrong for not lettingthem have them!!! They want LAWS!!! Hey, the ""right"" SS will march ifthis gets anywhere.SO OTHER THAN A FEW WEAK, ""I DON'T WANT YOUR KIDS"", HOW DO THE MEMBERS OFTHE NET FEEL? For, against, won't march with them, not your problem (if youbelieve that you're crazy), might even speak out against them (Why?)???But read from their literature:ANAL COPULATIONAt age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT (italicstheirs), can easily hold after massage, and will be allowed to have a teen-ager or older male's condom-covered penis in their anus. Tiny children willbe required to wear a small ""finger stall"" or ""finger cot"" (obtainable froma drug store) condom from age 4 or any earlier age that they start penetratingmale and female anuses. 99% of the day there is no fecal matter in the anus.No enema is required.ORAL COPULATIONAt age 4, and sometimes sooner, both male and female children WANT, can easilyhold, and will be allowed to have a tiny child, teenager, or older male's penisin their mouth. This will bring an end to thumbsucking. The child will atlast get valuable hormones that appear in the mature male's ejaculate that havebeen denied children in the past. Very young, teenage and adult females willbe allowed to provide sexual satisfaction with their mouths and tongues to thepenis and clitoris of young children.------------------------------And it goes on, PENIS-VAGINA COPULATION, MASTURBATION, NUDITY ALONE WITH NOSEXUAL ACTIONS, but I'm sick of typing what I'm typing.The main purpose of the organization is to convince the public that all lawscontrolling nonconsensual sex must be abolished.The above are part of a promotional package handed out by the Society as asummary of the revisions to the California Penal Code proposed by them.Sections PC286 Anal Copulation, PC288a Oral Copulation, see also PC261.1Penis-Vagina Copulation and PC288 & 288.1 Masturbation of a Child.(See THE HOMOSEXUAL NETWORK: PRIVATE LIVES AND PUBLIC POLICY, The Devin AdairCo., by Enrique T.

What mailing lists is heon anyway?Anyway, there was a rather long discussion of NAMBLA and children's rightsvery early on in net.motss, consisting of one person speaking out for totalself-determination for kids and even infants (in the large sense--this wasnot limited to ""intergenerational sexuality"", as it was genteely referredto) and most everyone else saying how bonkers that sounded to them. Idon't think there's much more to be said here.All main-stream national gay organizations that I know of explicitly tryto dissociate themselves from any such groups as NAMBLA. The key toremember here is that ""child/adult"" sex is NOT a gay rights issue, and theonly groups who seem to want to make it one are the anti-gay forces and themembers of such groups themselves. Even in Arndt's rather lurid excerptsfrom pedophiliac literature, there is interchangeable mention of bothfemale and male children: where are the gay issues here? Why did Arndt nottake this stuff to net.kids, or perhaps to net.singles and net.social,where he could take the straight community to task for their own shamefulmembers? Naturally not, for he has no corresponding axe to grind there.One thing is clear: net.motss is not the place for this discussion.Arndt is being just a touch disingenuous when he claims not wanting to""tar"" ""homosexuals"" with this brush, rivaling Paul DuBois' rejoiner,""Why, I'm only ASKING a QUESTION.""Just as in the community at large, there is no one voice in the gaycommunity (and it is debatable that one can even speak of THE gaycommunity.) Still, I think it is safe to say that only a very smallminority supports the aims of such groups, with most people eitheragainst or indifferent.One last comment about Arndt's feeling that his comments about AIDS andpromiscuity haven't received a response. Nope, they haven't, and it's nowonder. Actually, it would have made a fairly interesting discussion, butunfortunately Arndt wrote off all his credibility with a large majority ofnet.motss with his earlier obnoxious behavior. It's actually prettyhilarious to see the recent spate of defenses of Arndt: all the guy needsto do is put on a tie, and suddenly he becomes reconstructed in the guiseof martyr. Sorry, folks, all I have to judge him by are his words, andby my count, his recent postings haven't even BEGUN to offset his earlierbehavior.

This situation is not new:many of you probably remember thatArndt managed for some time to disrupt the debate also in net.women, fromwhich he was eventually expelled, never to reappear again. It is unlikely,though, that this will happen here too: differently from that case, nowMr. Arndt is persuaded to be waging a Holy War, and nothing we say willmake him desist from it. You all know how impermeable he is to every sortof argumentation, how uninterested he is in listening, and how badly he hasdamaged discussion in this group.There are two possible soultions to this problem: the first is whatwas proposed some time ago in net.women, i.e. the creation of a privatemail group from which any non-constructive contribution could be easilyexcluded. This feminist mail group is now alive and prospering, has receivedmore than 300 contributions, and the environment is so pleasant thatquite a number of people have told intimate personal stories. This is apossible way out.Alternatively, one may reason as follows: women's movements havegained a degree of acceptance which gay-rights movements are very far fromachieving, so that the retreat into a private mailgroup, which would bequite acceptable for women, is to be considered a political defeat in thiscase. Holding the debate in a public forum like this is also a partof 'coming out', and we shouldn't allow Mr. Arndt and his clones to shutevryone up, and lock the closet again.I see some pluses in this line of argument. But in this case,we should probably accept the obvious: no debate is possible with Mr. Arndtand the hypocrites who disapprove of his ways and approve of his ideas(which ones?) and of his carefully researched data (straight out ofJerry Falwell's pocket). We should then propose and enforce a policy oftotal neglect of Mr. Arndt, one by which none of his arguments is mentionedin any contribution, none of his lurid jokes and insinuations areanswered, none of his clones' support respected.This is very different from rejecting debate: it would onlymean restoring this forum to its original function (message # 1):>Net.motss is designed to foster discussion on a wide variety of topics, such as>health problems, parenting, relationships, clearances, job security and>many others.

Some people have gotten the impression that I am utterly > opposed to homosexuality. Aren't you ""utterly opposed""? Christ preached that intent to do evil is as bad as (& maybe more hypocritical & corrupting than) doing it. Cf. the quote about cutting body parts off that you commented on. As a Christian, do you not possess this belief? After all, what can you do about feelings (aversion therapy? electrodes in the brain?) or inclinations & desires (neuroscience hasn't identified these yet)? Or do you mean, you don't oppose homosexual fantasies, or maybe public cruising, gawking at Playgirl pinups, as long as it doesn't lead to sex? But remember what Christ said about ""lusting in your heart""! So aren't you in fact UTTERLY OPPOSED? > I am in fact in considerable doubt on the subject. But in the meantime, before you resolve your doubts one way or the other, your advice (""abstain from sex"") is as severe as any offered by homo- phobic publicists (excepting lunatic fringe crazies like Reagan adviser Paul Laxalt, who'd like to see homosexuality made a capital crime, or Rev. Falwell, who suggests concentration camps to contain AIDS; & I'd wager even Laxalt & Falwell would accede to your advice if they could be persuaded that gays can be chaste). > On the other hand, the NT is fairly clear about sexual promiscuity. > In that regard, my remark about chastity still applies. If the issue is promiscuity: chastity is neither the logical opposite nor the only alternative to promiscuity! Nonpromiscuity (sexual com- mitment or fidelity, which can be polygamous/androus) is. This logical goof and your linking of homosexuality to promiscuity seems one more example of how prejudice impairs judgment. > The NT is by no means clear on the subject [of homosexuality],.... Then how can you give such extreme advice? Christ's teaching emphasizes purity of intent, love, fidelity: the character of one's inner life and relations to others, and not overly scrupulous observance of codes minutely regulating external conduct. > I have a number of friends who are homosexuals, and I think that for > for almost all purposes, there is no reason to discriminate against > them.

I don't think your point about blacks andhomosexuals being analogous fits in this case, because blacksby and large have won their battle for acceptance, their moralcase anyway. I think that very few, on hearing of the Zebrakillings would say ""isn't that just like blacks?"". Indeed,that was your point, wasn't it. The question is, have thehomosexuals gained acceptence as a rightful minority? Eventhey say no. Therefore, it seems to me that many if not mostpeople, upon hearing of NAMBLA or the Rene Guyon Society WOULDlink them with all homosexuals. Witness the concern overallowing homosexual teachers!! Now homosexuals say that theyshould not be viewed this way - you have heard their statementson this net vis a vis teaching. Homosexuals may be right intheir statements but I don't think that they have gotten theagreement of the majority of parents out there, do you?

Being busy with other things has prevented me from even looking at net.motss. I got back so late, I have missed all of the responses (UCLA dumps them after a month, I think). Now I'm back for several months. In Los Angeles, the political diversity is extreme and many organizations are quite active. I'll try to encapsulate some information about the ones I'm familiar with: CHRISTOPHER STREET WEST This organization puts on the annual Christopher Street West parade and festival in July. The organizers are mainly representatives of the gay bar owners and gay-oriented shopkeepers in West Hollywood, and the parade and festival take on the expected air. The parade is filled with floats from different gay bars, dating services, and so forth. Political groups and activity-oriented groups are very poorly represented in both the parade and the festival. This is partially due to the high price tag of participation, and perhaps partially due to the biases of the organizers. The CSW board of directors is quite inbred. While most community groups are run by the people that attend meetings regularly, in order to serve on the CSW board you must be elected by the board itself. The process involved in getting on the board takes approximately one year of meeting attendence, plus making lots of friends on the board. Once you have been elected to the board, you can be booted off by an election of the board (and this has been done a number of times). A leading member of CSW, George Piazzi, seems to be extremely conservative. He is running for a position on the West Hollywood city council. There was almost nothing oriented toward gay rights in this year's parade and festival. The reason, unfortunately, is quite apparent. SUNSET JUNCTION STREET FAIR In sharp contrast to CSW, the people who organize the Sunset Junction Street Fair (held in late August) are very community-oriented. Situated in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, Sunset Junction attempts to bring in all segments of the community. Silver Lake is populated by gays, latins, and a few orientals. Sunset Junction incorporates all these elements, with music, food, and entertainment from each. There were many political groups represented at Sunset Junction, including Gay/Lesbian Latinos Unidos, Log Cabin Club, Harvey Milk, ad nauseum. The theme seems to be diversity. Unfortunately, I have no idea how the organization functions. Probably more egalitarianly than CSW. GAY/LESBIAN LATINOS UNIDOS This group has a number of community-oriented events during the year. The one I attended most recently was their annual dinner/dance, where they install their new officers (elected by vote of members). It was quite fun. The food was excellent and spicy. I got to sit across the table from Steve Schulte and his lover, who both appear on the front cover of the late September Advocate. Steve Schulte is running for West Hollywood city council, and will probably be the mayor. He is also an ex-Colt model (politics makes strange bedfellows). GLLU also has participated in several political events, including the SurvivalFest held August 5th in central Los Angeles. They seem to be quite left-wing, sporting such slogans as ""CIA out of Nicaragua,"" and the like. GLLU, as far as I know, is a fairly new group, but its membership has grown rapidly. I don't know much more about it. GAY AND LESBIAN ASSOCIATION (GALA) GALA is the local campus (UCLA) organization. Its primary purpose, as with most campus organizations, is to assist in the process of ""coming out."" Thus, GALA activities tend to be social, rather than political. They have regular ""rap sessions,"" regular meetings with speakers on different aspects of gay life (from AIDS to the Gay Archives), and occasional ""quasi-political"" events. One such event was the Western Region Gay and Lesbian Conference, held at UCLA. This drew people from the UC campuses, as well as political heavies from Sacramento (California's capitol city). In addition, they organized a letter-writing campaign for AB-1 (California's gay rights bill). Because they are a special interest group on campus, with a big campus budget and an office, they are generally prohibited from doing anything visibly political, like rallies. UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA There is nothing (political or social) going on here, as far as I know. Strange, since I know several gays on campus there. I think the administration might be homophobic. SUMMARY This has been kind of sketchy, but perhaps it gives you a flavor of the kinds of activities in Los Angeles. There are several groups I didn't describe, mostly because I know very little about them. These include: the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, Harvey Milk Gay Democratic Club, the Stonewall Democratic Club, the Log Cabin Club (a group of very confused gays ... they are Republicans), Great Outdoors (a hiking group).

Precisely what I was trying to indicate, Kenny. AIDS is serum-vectored not 'homosexual vectored.' Among the other ailments that are carried this way are certain forms of hepatitis, mononucleosis, and a large variety of more common infections. The first identifiable breakout just happens to have been in the gay population. It could have as easily been among drug addicts, pro football players or army privates. The first instances of Bubonic plague were recorded among sailors in the 13th Century. That doesn't mean they were in any sense responsible for it. Was the American Legion responsible for Legionaire's Disease? >What does ""YOUR assertions notwithstanding, Aids is a potentially serious >problem to the entire population . . . "" mean?? The point of my postings >was that very fact!!! It seems clear to me that the point of your postings is to try to place blame. That doesn't help anyone who happens to contract AIDS and it certainly doesn't protect either of us. Do you have anything constructive to offer? If so, I missed it in the smart *ss comments. >I see it was late when you posted so I can only assume you were down to >your last toke before you fell off your chair for the night.

NO way. ""I'll take my child out."" So what are YOU going to do about it? If AIDS is in the general population then it is a public health problem and everyone's responsibility. What are you trying to do? From the tone and content of your postings all I can gather is that you are asking gays to take it back! The smugness that frightens me is that you seem to think you are somehow immune. I got news for you. Viruses mutate. It's what they do. That's how the disease got here in the first place according to some. Should this bug 'decide' to become airborne then we're all in a heap o' trouble and no amount of screaming that 'the gays did it' is going to get us out of that trouble. >Hey, it's getting bigger by the minute.

Situations arise whereemotions erupt into a verbal free-for-all that can lead to hurt feelings.Please remember that people all over the world are reading your words. Donot attack people if you cannot persuade them with your presentation ofthe facts. Screaming, cursing, and abusing others only serves to makepeople think less of you and be less willing to help you when you need it.If you are upset at something or someone, wait until you have had a chanceto calm down and think about it.

Try not to say anything to others you would not say to themin person in a room full of people.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now, lets see what juicy lines we find from Ken:Ken-> And never to know that one womanwho above all others fills your life as a woman, tostand beside her as she gives birth to your child -Doesn't hurt you? YOU LEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE!!Ken, sometimes I wonder why I reply. I should just stand back and letyou dig your own grave. Does it surprise you to know that I takepersonal offense at your comments? Would you like to be called aLEAPING SCREAMING ASSHOLE? That's pretty rude, Ken. If I was female, Isure hope that I wouldn't have to 'fill your life.' It must be a prettytedious job.Ken-> Some laws against homosexuals ARE being enforced (in thearmed forces, - try waving it around in the park as a signof ""affection"" in the heartland or here in New Hampsterand see if the laws are being enforced).I don't really want to imagine what 'waving it around in the park'means. Whatever it is, I don't do it. And am I my brother(homosexual's) keeper? Well, they can do what they want, but PLEASEdon't assume that all gay people are the same, Ken. It's really theminority that have bathroom sex, visit the baths, get AIDS. Did youknow that according to the Center for Disease Control, the average AIDSpatient (gay male with AIDS) had more than 60 sexual partners a year?And the percentage of those partners that were found in bathhouses wereabout 85%. I'm NOT trying to justify this, I think it's AWFUL, butplease don't paint us all with the same brush. That's like saying thatall black people are stupid and walk around carrying ghetto blasters. ItMAY be TRUE in a few cases, but BY and LARGE it's a grossgeneralization.Ken--> And of course we know that things are not going to revertto the bad old days in the closet, right? Wrong bozo.See below.Bozo? Read the paragraphs on top again, once or twice.Ken--> I'm reminded of the first Russian soldiers into Berlin.They were very well behaved towards the civilians. Justinterested in killing German soldiers. But one of themis quoted as saying, ""Look out for those who come behindus. They are pigs."" He was right. And my point here isthat you might be a lot better off than you think if I DIDset the values. I'm not for putting you all in jail - yet!(THANK YOU, ken. You're SO kind. *sarcasm*)A sea story-> (oh goody) To illustrate my limits.I remember being in a long line in boot camp, shortarm inspection or something, and there was this guyon the floor in the hall who couldn't take the wholeboot camp bit and was crying. I felt so bad I wantedto step out of line and comfort him. Some of the otherguys were kicking him as they went by. By the time Icame abreast of him I had decided to kick him too. SoI did! It's great to be part of a tradition!!(It's great to be an a--hole)(Sorry. I guess I should read the top, also)Now the point of that little sea story, in case youmissed it, is that there are values and there arevalues.Tell me Ken, when you see someone suffering, do you enjoy making themsuffer more? And PLEASE STOP this 'military defense' of your points. IKNOW (from extrapolation on personal experience) that there areTHOUSANDS of gays in the military around the country. And they servetheir country well. Stop thinking that people are EXCLUSIVLY gay. Thatis not the case. Being gay is NOT the #1 thing in the lives of manyhomosexuals. (I'll admit, though, it is the #1 thing for SOME people)As for your statement that homosexual behavior is becoming moreaccepted, why there is evidence that that is just not so, evenwith the new T.V. shows. We are just now entering into the time(Sorry. I don't watch tv, nor have the time or desire to do so.)when the baby boomers are coming of age and THEY are the oneswho will be setting the values over the next quarter century!Guess what? They are more conservative than their parents!Read the poles. They are by a huge majority for Reagan and(I have never tried to read a polish person. They might get mad)his values. You do know where he stands on the moral issuedon't you?One of the BEST things about Raygun :-) is that he HASN'T done to muchabout moral issues. And with a son like his......

Besides I'm only calling you on thepart that IS your problem - the gays who ARE pedopheliaprone. But I feel I've answered this in my replies toRichard Johnson and Steve Dyer.Are they my problem, Ken? I'm not so sure. Are the whites in theghetto your problem? Are the men who rape little girls 'your' problem?Also, read the paragraph atop this posting AGAIN! What do you mean by'chicken neck'? You're getting REALLY rude. I'm sure you'll beleading that mob, Ken, but I intend to meet you (and whatever mob you'vegathered) with a machine gun and plenty of bullets.Ken--> I just know you'll wake up tomorrow morning and say I wasright and go out and grab a woman. (If you get stuck onwhat to do after you grab call me.)Ken, that's really funny. Havn't you ever had anyone tell you how thegay guys get all the girls?

These 14 establishments are notfostering gay liberation.

AIDS is serum-vectorednot 'homosexual vectored.'***(Ken now)Wrong!!! A vector is, ""an insect or other ORGANISM (italicsmine) transmitting germs or other agents of disease"" - Am Coll. Dict.The serum is merely the medium the virus is in, NOT the vector. Or to put itanother way, the action (behavior) of the vector passes the virus, the serum isneutral. It is the behavior of the vector, in this case homosexuals whichpasses on the disease. Such as anal intercourse, which often causes minutetearing of the small blood vessels in the lower bowel and makes possible thepassing of the virus. Also the passing of other serums (saliva, semen)transmits the virus.************************NOW HEAR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!************************I am NOT, that is NOT, saying that homosexuals are responsible for AIDS!The virus is, of course!! They are responsible (the promiscuous ones, rememberthe same way promiscuous hetrosexuals are responsible for other sexuallyrelated diseases) for the TRANSMISSION of the disease virus!!!!!If you, or anyone else, cares to remember I started this whole thing by saying""smugly of course"" AIDS would be a hammar blow to drive the homosexuals backinto the closet and what are the gays doing about that. The answer so soonforthcoming, from Steve Dyer, et al, was ""EEk, get away from me, you roughtrade you. How dare you even ASK such a question, etc., etc."" They treatedme like a fart at a cheeze tasters ball. I know, I know, I didn't say ""mayI"" and tell how much I think you all contribute to civilization and whatgreat guys and gals you all are otherwise.I would have thought a reasonable response would have been, ""yes we have aproblem and here is what we are doing about it . . . ie. speaking out againstbath house sex as unhealthy if not psychologically, then from a physicalstandpoint.

It could have as easily been amongdrug addicts, pro football players or army privates. The first instancesof Bubonic plague were recorded among sailors in the 13th Century. Thatdoesn't mean they were in any sense responsible for it. Was the AmericanLegion responsible for Legionaire's Disease?*****(Ken replies now)Well, it actually started in Africa and the Carib. but yes in theU.S.of A. it ""came out"" in the gay community. Again, I agree with you thatthe gays are not responsible for the virus!!! But they ARE, that's ARE,responsible for continuing to be the vector once it became known HOW thevirus was passed!! To take measures (filter blood supply, avoid contact, etc)against the vector is a reasonable thing to do. And homosexuals themselvesare taking steps to guard against getting the disease.**************Note: No one is taking steps against the serum!! Wiping out spit, semen,blood. Isn't that because the serum is not the vector???? What IS beingdone, or at least ought to be done, is to take steps against the vector.Bath houses ARE being closed.

The point of allmy postings was, and is, to get responses from the gay community as to howthey plan to deal with the very real dangers that confront them.

That's not the point ofany of my postings.I see a tidal wave of events shaping up before the gay community that willwipe them out!!!! You mumble and press the ""n"" key. Great! Maybe theSmithsonian will be able to preserve a few of you in pickle jars.[By the way, I have been toying with a piece on the impact of ""modern"" ethicsas seen in statements by bioethicists on abortion, on the homosexual community.That is, if gays are ever seen as a ""diseased"" danger, a quality of life issue,or a threat to the majority's value system if that value system doesn't includeany idea of the value of the individual.

Dolber,"Dolber, Paul C.",,1,A0322,,,A0322,Form and Substance,Net.motss,"[But it's *cold*!]Complaints about Ken Arndt in net.motss tend to take one (or all) ofthree directions: he's not supportive, he's unintelligible, or he'srude. In response to the complaint that he's rude and unsupportive,some have argued that he appears to be knowledgable and perhaps, attimes, even reasonable. In response to such responses, others havedenied the possibility that he may be reasonable, argued that hisrudeness is the main point to be considered, and/or suggested that heattempt to become intelligible that his points, if there be any besidesa hypothetical one atop his head, be better understood.Let me reject the ""not supportive"" complaint out of hand; why someonemust be supportive to be heard escapes my understanding. (After all,I tolerate liberals in net.politics -- though it appears some havegreat difficulty tolerating me.) And I think that most net.motssreaders, gay and otherwise, agree. (Let me also reject the complaintnot noted above, that he has no answers to the problems he raises.Who does?) Leaving, of the three types of complaints I noted, that heis frequently unintelligible and rude.On to intelligibility. I frequently find such luminaries as Sartre,Connell, Eliot, Hamsun, Lagerkvist, Pynchon, Brecht, Ionesco, andBaudelaire... unintelligible. On the other hand, I sometimes findthem intelligible, which sustains me in reading their works. And Ihave found that it is generally true that just that which makes themso often unintelligible makes their message, when I am hit with it,so forceful. Now, one need not include Ken in the list above -- i.e.,as of the same rank -- to consider the possibility that his style suitshim as the best to get across his points. To make a point, it maysometimes be necessary to strike the listener in the face with a deadfish. Would you reduce the efforts of, say, Ionesco to that which wouldfit on a bumper sticker? (It would save a lot of trees; ""The Lesson""could be reduced to ""Communication is Fraught with Difficulty,"" andcertainly everyone would understand that communication.) Wouldyou wait till the author died, and read the books of criticism aboutthe author's work? It's usually easier than reading the work itself.Would you have the author write an essay as dull as this one (albeitin better prose, no doubt)? Or would you admit the possibility that theauthor embedded his meaning as much in the form of his work as in thewords? That in order to understand it, you had to do more thanintellectualize? (I remember, from Personality Theory or AbnormalPsychology, when the professor explained ""intellectualization"" asthe defense mechanism which enabled 150 male students to hear him saysomething like ""All males hate their fathers because they secretly wantto have sexual intercourse with their mothers,"" busily write it down,and wait for the next point. Having missed the last one.)Not that I think I've convinced anyone of anything, but let's get onto rudeness. Really not getting on at all, since the same pointraised above -- that attention may be better commanded by strikingthe listener in the face with a dead fish than by writing a deadlyboring essay such as I am now doing -- applies here. Maybe youshould regard Arndt as an onion in the stew of life, and not expectyour reasoned arguments to turn him into a carrot.The suggestion has been tendered that someone, not Ken, who readsan Arndt message and espies some redeeming quality there, translatethe message for the edification of the remainder of the crew. A badidea, I think, but since I am filled (indeed, brimming over) withpolite language (rather gray, but it doesn't disturb anyone as longas I don't mention National Review), let me try an example. Kenrecently wrote in an article that when in boot camp he felt sorryfor a crying recruit who was kicked by every other recruit who passedhim, including, when Ken got to him, Ken. Some net.motss readersread this as a brave ""coming out of the closet"" on Ken's part,others as an expression of Ken's wimpiness/rudeness/brutality.Enter Mr. Explain-it-in-all-gray-tones! Ahem. ""In the message fromKen, which you are not reading because its style, nay, its verylanguage, was deemed inappropriate, Ken related an anecdote, orperhaps a parable, to the effect that today's polite sympathy may nottranslate into polite actions on the morrow."" Really grabbed you, eh?Thought so.(You know, as I was mentally composing this essay, I kept hearingMuzak playing when I thought of the brave new world we all expectwhen everyone talks and writes ever so politely, and reasonably,like, say, me. I couldn't figure out why the damned Muzak wasplaying for a couple of hours, when I suddenly was hit by theshopping market scene at the end of ""Stepford Wives."" I'd explainthe scene in words, but I'm afraid I'd gray so far as to disappear.)Listen, I suspect two things: That Ken is damned nigh well unique(certainly on this net), and that the kind of person many net.motssreaders think he is, is not. It's the latter you've got to lookout for and try to sway. Run off to mod.motss if you will, wherethe moderator will protect you from immoderate opinions -- butif everything turns to shit, and the world comes tumbling downon your head, please refrain from asking ""But they all seemed sonice! What happened?""I can sense that some of you (most of you?) are still unconvinced.Very well, in better polite language than my own...""Perhaps there is really no such thing as a Revolutionrecorded in history. What happened was always a Counter-Revolution. Men were always rebelling against the lastrebels; or even repenting of the last rebellion. Thiscould be seen in the most casual contemporary fashions,if the fashionable mind had not fallen into the habit ofseeing the very latest rebel as rebelling against allages at once. The Modern Girl [this written in 1933]with the lipstick and the cocktail is as much a rebelagainst the Women's Rights Woman of the '80's, with herstiff stick-up collars and strict teetotalism, as thelatter was a rebel against the Early Victorian lady of thelanguid waltz tunes and the album full of quotations fromByron; or as the last, again, was a rebel against aPuritan mother to whom the waltz was a wild orgy andByron the Bolshevist of his age. Trace even the Puritanmother back through history and she represents a rebellionagainst the Cavalier laxity of the English Church, whichwas at first a rebel against the Catholic civilisation,which had been a rebel against the Pagan civilisation.Nobody but a lunatic could pretend that these thingswere a progress; for they obviously go first one way andthen the other.""[From G.K. Chesterton's ""Saint Thomas Aquinas,"" Image Books, GardenCity, New York, pp. 76-77, 1956. Which is, of course, irrelevantbecause it was written by (a) a conservative who (b) is dealing witha religious topic.]Of course, Ken may be simply as you see him: a rude and unintelligibleboor. Yes, Ken could be exactly what many of you think he is, a badboy so typical of the religious right. So typical.Keep your eyes on him.Stew without onions? None for me, thanks.

We are discussing, not ""supportiveness""(UGGH), not ""agreement"" (UGGH UGGH), but civility and the ability totreat a discussion and its members seriously. Right now, there isonly one proper place for his sentiments, and that is in net.flame.Let's get one thing clear here. If he acted this way in any othernewsgroup, he would be dismissed immediately as a crank. If he behaved inpublic similar to the way he writes in net.motss, he would be dragged offfor psychiatric observation, presumably kicking and screaming still.Why are the standards for net.motss any different than other groupson USENET? They are not.Arndt tried the same behavior in net.woman, and was summarily asked toclean up his act. For some strange reason (perhaps he has fewer personaltroubles with women's issues than with gay issues) he more or less obeyed.I suspect strongly (correct me if I'm wrong) that Mr. Dolber and Mr. Moffettand any other private apologists for Arndt's behavior have come to thisdiscussion a little late. When Arndt first started behaving so bizarrely,other contributors to net.motss attempted to take him seriously. We cometo this action now only after an exhausting six months or so of enduringhis tiresome anti-social behavior. The readers and contributors to net.motsscould not be seriously accused of intolerance by anyone who knows the facts.Let's make another thing clear: net.motss and mod.motss are not ""the realworld"", they are discussion groups. It is an appalling, ignorant chargethat gay people would prefer to live in a ""protected"" fantasy world, simplybecause the members of net.motss would like to discuss important issuesseriously in an environment free of hecklers. First, only some of themembers of net.motss are gay. Second, it is only by such apologists thatinfernal caterwauling has suddenly become a virtue. It is only throughsuch apologists that the inability to express an idea clearly is nowirrelevant to serious discourse. It is right and responsible to expecta certain standard of behavior in most USENET newsgroups, just as it isright and responsible to have standards of public behavior. By no stretchof the imagination does the history of Arndt's behavior in net.motss fitany such standard. By Mr. Dolber's standards, we should allow children toscream in the middle of a performance, and we should acquiesce when aseries of hecklers stand up and disrupt a lecture. Hey, that's the realworld, right?Arndt should be judged on his own boorish behavior, not as a representative ofany movement other than Ken Arndt, Inc.And to reiterate the subject line here, we are discussing form and notcontent.

They are ALREADY SET and the homosexual rights movement is trying to change them. That's their whole point - the values are there. I'm reminded of the first Russian soldiers into Berlin. They were very well behaved towards the civilians. Just interested in killing German soldiers. But one of them is quoted as saying, ""Look out for those who come behind us. They are pigs."" He was right. And my point here is that you might be a lot better off than you think if I DID set the values. I'm not for putting you all in jail - yet! You know how some other countries treat homosexuals - and don't think it couldn't happen here!!! I admit though, even I have limits: A sea story-> (oh goody) To illustrate my limits. I remember being in a long line in boot camp, short arm inspection or something, and there was this guy on the floor in the hall who couldn't take the whole boot camp bit and was crying. I felt so bad I wanted to step out of line and comfort him. Some of the other guys were kicking him as they went by. By the time I came abreast of him I had decided to kick him too. So I did! It's great to be part of a tradition!! Now the point of that little sea story, in case you missed it, is that there are values and there are values. People may give lip service to the idea of homosexual rights but if the lid comes off the homosexual health crisis (seen the T.V. adds about hepatitis? call this 800 # ""to find out if you are in the high risk group"" Gee Martha, what group is that?, they're starting to ask in East Overshoe) or too many more stories like the one about the little eight year old girl in Texas a few nights ago (with her mother crying on the couch ""I just want to hold her again and tell her I love her"") who appears to have been taken by a pervert make the nightly news we may, indeed I say we will, see a DEMAND to ""clean up"". I quote the sheriff in the town where the little girl was taken, ""If the courts can't protect us, we'll do it ourselves"". This guy had been let out after several sex offenses. Of course the mob is going to stop and say, ""No wait, they're only a couple of nice gay boys who don't have anything to do with this."" As for your statement that homosexual behavior is becoming more accepted, why there is evidence that that is just not so, even with the new T.V. shows. We are just now entering into the time when the baby boomers are coming of age and THEY are the ones who will be setting the values over the next quarter century! Guess what? They are more conservative than their parents! Read the poles. They are by a huge majority for Reagan and his values. You do know where he stands on the moral issue don't you? But let me quote from a pro homosexual source: 1978 poll showed 70% of Americans believed that homosexual acts always wrong even if the people are in love. ""Typically Americans feel that homosexuals can be eliminated by concerted social action."" 1979 poll of entering UCLA freshmen 39%females,56%males said ""homosexual relations should be prohibited"" 1977 Gallop poll listed 56% of Americans as saying homosexuality was due to upbringing or environment. (All the above taken from GAYSPEAK:GAY MALE AND LESBIAN COMMUNICATION, Pilgrim Press, N.Y.,1981, pg.ix.) This book, which is well worth looking at, deals with what and who are homosexuals. Ok so the polls may be dated. But ask yourself, has the country gotten more or less conservative since then? Has there been a move back to ""traditional values""? When is the last time before just now that you saw a liberal democrat hectored by people over traditional values? Who is Jerry Falwell and why is he able to register the same number or more voters as the Rev. JJ in the south? - he's doing it in all 50 states (ABC news)? And in reference to the statement 'is MOTSS a microcosm of society', the definite answer is NO! Society in general does not use UNIX, does not post messages to the UUCP net. And until they do, we have to realize that we are dealing with a subgroup of humanity, a very select subgroup, with probably the same amount of homosexuals as the rest of society, but not your 'average homosexualty'. ** don't recognize my making this statement. And in reference to pedophelia, it DOES NOT BELONG HERE! Pedophelia is not limited to gays AT ALL, why stick it on us. Sure, it's a problem but in the same way murder is a problem around society, it's not a specifically GAY problem. ** Keep saying that, . . . as the mob puts the rope around your chicken neck. Besides I'm only calling you on the part that IS your problem - the gays who ARE pedophelia prone. But I feel I've answered this in my replies to Richard Johnson and Steve Dyer. Also, I though you were going, Ken. Why don't you just do what you said you were going to do, or admit you like being able to make people mad at you who you will never see. I really don't care especially, but I worry about those people who read motss and never post anything, because I know that the general consensus is that you are a feeb, and really should be ignored. ** Sorry to be such a tease. And an upset. I really don't want to know what the general consensus is (is feeb). I want to know what is right. Listen Andy, if I'm so wrong, why are you guys so mad? Like you say just ignore an idiot. I do. You people are not idiots in my book, just mistaken. But you are close, gang. I mean have you really read some of the silly statements I've had thrown at me? I just know you'll wake up tomorrow morning and say I was right and go out and grab a woman. (If you get stuck on what to do after you grab call me.) Shiiiiiit!

The Commission may also on its own motion issue a complaint, whenever it has reason to believe that any person has engaged in an unlawful practice in violation of the Ordinance. No complaint shall be considered unless it is filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the occurrence of the alleged unlawful practice, or unless it has been referred to the Commission by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination after having been timely filed with either or both agencies. The filing of a complaint, the failure to file a complaint, or the dismissal of a complaint by the Commission shall not bar the complainant from seeking relief by means of a civil action filed in the Cambridge District Court, or the district court for the judicial district in which the respondent resides, or an other court of competent jurisdiction. Not shall finding or failing to file a complaint with other federal, state, or city agencies or courts bar the complainant from seeking relief through the Commission. (2.) After the filing of any complaint, the Chairperson of the Commission shall designate the Executive Director or one or more of the Commissioners to oversee a prompt investigation thereof with the assistance of the staff of the Commission. If such Commissioner(s) determine after such investigation that no probable cause exists for crediting the allegations of the complaint, they shall promptly file a report of such findings with the Commission, which shall determine whether or not to dismiss the complaint. The Commission shall, within ten days from such determination, notify the complainant in writing of such determination. If such Commissioner(s) determine after such investigations that probable cause does exist for crediting the allegations of the complaint or if the Commission so determines, notwithstanding a negative report from such Commissioner(s), the Commission shall forthwith endeavor by conference, conciliation, and persuasion to eliminate the unlawful practice. The Commission and its staff shall not disclose what has occurred in the course of such endeavors except to disclose the terms of conciliation when the complaint has been disposed of in this manner. (3.) In the case of failure to eliminate an alleged unlawful practice by the process of mediation or after ninety (90) days have passed from commencement of mediation, or if probable cause exists that a conciliation agreement has been violated, the Commission shall issue and serve in its name a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, requiring the person named in the complaint (hereinafter called ""the respondent"") to answer the charges of the complaint at a hearing of the Commission at a reasonable time and place specified in such notice. The respondent may file a written verified answer to the complaint and appear at such hearing in person, with or without counsel, and submit testimony. The Commission may designate a staff member to present evidence on behalf of the complainant or may permit the complainant to do so himself or herself or by counsel. The Commission shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and recorded, and shall be transcribed at the request of any party. (4.) If , upon all the evidence, the Commission shall find that a respondent has not engaged in any unlawful practice or violation of this Ordinance, the Commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant an order dismissing the said complaint as to said respondent. If, upon all the evidence, the Commission shall find that a respondent has engaged in any unlawful practice or violation of this Ordinance, the Commission shall state its findings of fact and shall forthwith seek relief through one or more of the following actions: a. File a criminal complaint against the respondent in the Cambridge District Court or in the district court for the judicial district in which the respondent resides, seeking fines of up to Three Hundred Dollars ($300), or the maximum under State law, for each violation. b. Levy a fine on its own motion of up to Three Hundred Dollars ($300), or the maximum under State law, for each such violation. c. File a complaint against the respondent in Superior Court seeking injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order; or d. File a complaint against the respondent in a court of appropriate jurisdiction seeking the award to the complainant of damages, expenses, punitive damages, and other relief, as appropriate. The Commission may be represented in court by the City Solicitor or by its own attorneys. 9. A. Any practice that by design or effect discriminates against individuals, because of race, color, sex, age, religious creed, diability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, military status, or source of income is of public concern, as such discrimination creates strife, hostility and unrest, threatens or impairs the rights and privileges of individuals and deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society. Discrimination that deprives individuals of equal opportunities is unjust and results in serious injury to the public safety, health, and welfare of this City. Accordingly, it is the policy of the City of Cambridge to safeguard the equal opportunities of all individuals in the City in accordance with their abilities, regardless of their race, color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, military status, or source of income and to prevent discrimination against such individuals in the provision of city services and in employment, housing and real estate, education, credit, bonding, insurance, and public accommodations. Further, it is the policy of the City to encourage harmony and mutual respect among its inhabitants and visitors and to reduce tensions and strife caused by discrimination. B. The provisions of this Ordinance shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes hereof, and any ordinances of portions thereof inconsistent with any provisions hereof shall not apply. This Ordinance shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the City of Cambridge for the protection of the public safety, health, prosperity, and welfare. C. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit civil rights granted or hereinafter afforded by the laws of the federal government or of this Commonwealth. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present of future law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the United States, other than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be unlawful under this Ordinance.

""Most of the darkest suspicions that scientists & gayactivists had long voiced about the lack of commitment to AIDS research bythe Reagan administration were confirmed....A stark portrait of governmentduplicity which was quietly accepted by AIDS researchers in the CDC emerges....""This information had to be obtained by a Freedom of Information Act requestby Congress & from a 33-page report issued by Weiss' HSGOH. ""CDC fiercelyopposed"" the FIA request, & was FORCED to surrender the desired memorandawhen the CDC refusal was appealed & publication of some of the memos byWeiss' HSGOH in their report seemed imminent.The released information revealed:1. ""Some of the same officials who assured Congress that the federal gov'thad all the AIDS money it needed were privately pleading for more fundsfrom budget officials."" CDC AIDS Task Force coord. Dr. James Curran notablyindulged in this form of prevarication, almost constantly claiming he hador would soon receive funds that he knew didn't even exist!2. ""Within 5 months of its formation, the CDC's AIDS Task Force (ATF) wasvainly begging the agency management for more funds & shortages have seri-ously retarded the CDC's efforts throughout the AIDS epidemic.""3. ""Much of the money that the CDC did spend on AIDS was diverted fromother important health needs.""4. ""The failure to expediate funds for AIDS research meant that nosignificant outlay of funds reached researchers until March 1983--almost two years after AIDS was first detected.""5. ""Serious misunderstandings about which federal agencies would handlevarious aspects of the AIDS epidemic also seriously delayed research.""CDC has received a ""good press"" from the media (excluding the gay presswhich knew better, & was virtually alone in being critical & followingevents closely), yet all during this period (1981-3) it was in factstarved for funds.Here's a closer history of events as revealed in internal HHS memos:As early as June 1981 the CDC knew that AIDS was a serious epidemic:they'd assigned staffers to it from its VD project. By December""when the number of cases had soared"", they were aware of themagnitude of the task. But they severely lacked funds. Curran sub-mitted a 6-months budget for a piddling $833,300. But HHS did notrespond. AT ALL. Finally, Congress allocated $500,000 in August,8 months late. REAGAN VETOED THE APPROPRIATION.Congress overturned the veto, & Curran finally received the money inSeptember. By that time, the number of cases had quintupled.Funding for 1983 ""fared little better"". Administration budget cuttersforced CDC to recalculate its budget THREE TIMES, the final AIDS figurebeing 60% below the original one. CDC Aids Task Force director Dr.William Rushing included the following with his budget proposal: ""Asyou know, the attached budget is insufficient to adequately fund AIDSsurveillance & epidemiologic studies. However, we will continue with\thehighest priority activities until additional funds become available.""Finally Congress alllocated $2 million more for the CDC in December 1982;""like other money that Congress would later appropriate, however, theAIDS funding came in spite of the statements of federal health officials,not because of them.""In August 1982 the CDC wanted to set up a national AIDS surveillancesystem, but had no money for it. For the next 18 months, CDC ""dependedon doctors & health officials to call them up & tell them about AIDScases..."", an absurd situation for a federal health agency to be induring a national epidemic.""We lost all that data -- two years of cases are now irretrievable. Allthat time I was saying we should do the work & Curran was telling us hedidn't have the money,"" said Dr. David Ostrow, an AIDS researcher atNorthwestern.Researchers weho do get funds got inadequate ones: SF's Dr. Andrew Mossreceived $30,000 to monitor AIDS epidemiology for the CDC. ""They giveyou $30,000 -- it;s such an interesting sum. It's too much to turn down,but not enough to do anything meaningful. It's similar to everythingabout AIDS.""The CDC AIDS Tsk Force's major piece of work, a case control study, waspublished 18 months after it was finished; epidemiologists criticizedits findings as ""sorely out of date"".The Reagan administration's AIDS effort continued to be ""malnourished,slipsod, disorganized, & bogged down by cumbersome bureaucracy"" in1983. By May, Brandt was alarmed & wrote to the HHS asst. sec. formamangement & budget: ""It has now reached the point where importantAIDS work cannot be undertaken because of the lack of available re-sources."" Then CDC director Dr. William Foege added a long list ofprojects ""postponed, delayed, or seriously curtailed"" because ""moneywas diverted to AIDS. These included studies on hepatitis, influ-enza among the elderly, & rabies.""""Just two weeks later, however, Thomas Donelly, who is in charge ofbudgets at HHS, wrote a senate staffer that `we are not in favor ofadditional appropriations' for AIDS research.""""Brandt, Foege, & other health officials were also testifying beforeCongress that they had enough funds for AIDS even while they wereprivately begging for more money.""In late May the House was about to pass an appropriation of an extra$12 million for AIDS; at this time Brandt wrote ""that while the HHSwas not requesting more funds, they would `not oppose' having theauthority to transfer $12 million from other parts of the budgetinto AIDS""!!In September, HSGOH decided to add $22 million to the administration's$17 million request (""only a 20 % increase over the previous year'sbudget levels""). HSGOH ""staffers think Republican committee membersleaked word to the administration because days later, Margaret Heckler.secretary of HHS, made a highly-publicized announcement that the adminis-tration would commit $40 million to AIDS research next year. Heckler'sannouncement did not mention thatthis allocation was a FAIT ACCOMPLIbecause of the secret House vote--and it did not mention that even the$40 million was $10 million BELOW whatthe CDC requested for AIDS research.""""`Normally when you have an epidemic, the health people are begging youfor money', fumed Congresswoman Barbara Boxer of San Francisco, who co-sponsored legislation for more AIDS funding. `Here we were begging themfor information on what they needed & they kept telling us that they didn'tneed any money. It was unbelievable.'""""In Washington, Dr. Edward Brandt, the administration's top health official,brushed aside suggestions that he had been dishonest about the federal AIDSeffort. He didn't need to ask for money, he insisted, because Congressgave it to him anyway.`By the time I put in a request & it goes through all the processes,Congress passes the money [indeed!],' Brandt told the Native. `It'sdifficult to ever say you have enough money. In one sense, as long asyou have the disease, you could say we don't have enough money. All Ican say is that the money is there now.'""""Though most scientists agree that the long-delayed money is now comingfrom the federal government, some think that the government has irretriev-ably lost its credibility with the scientific community.""""Weiss' report requests that the gov't institute policies to expeditefunding of research grants &, most significantly, establish an independent[of CDC, HHS] commission to map an overall strategy to fight AIDS.... Thebudget would THEN BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO CONGRESS, CIRCUMVENTING THEREAGAN BUDGET SLASHERS [my italics]. The panel itself implicitly reflectsthe most serious charge within just about every paragraph of [HSGOH's]report: the Reagan administration has been lying through its teeth aboutthe adequacy of AIDS funding for 2 years.""There is much more information & events described in Shilts' article.But the hour grows late, & my fingers are getting tired.As some kind of a bench mark to make sense of the dollar amounts mentionedabove, a while ago HHS asked for funds merely to develop a few tests foranimal experiments preparatory to the real bulk of research; they asked forat least $197 million. Also remember that Congressional appropriationsamounts are limited by a factor the administration isn't: the constantobstacle of a Reagan veto.[Gay Community News, 10/27/84, Jim Ryan, ""Health Director Resigns"", p. 1]Ass't Sec. of HHS Dr. Edward Brandt, the nation's top physician, resignsat the end of this year. For all his shortcomings in performance & hisprevaricating, Brandt is a competent professional who showed a willingnessto work with gay organizations and was free of political ideology, if notinfluence.""The direction & extent of the gov't's research [on AIDS] depends in nosmall measure on who is appointed to replace Brandt.... Any decision ona successor will emanate from the Oval Office."" That is, on tomorrow'selection result.""Many fear"" Reagan will nominate C. Everett Koop, currently Surgeon Gene-ral. He's been ""widely criticized for his opposition to abortion, formaking numerous homophobic remarks, & for close ties to fundamentalistChristian organizations.Brandt was given credit for obtaining more AIDS funds at one point: heleaked a letter he wrote to his boss, Margaret Heckler, forcing Heckler'shand. Apparently Brandt thought there was good reason to believe Hecklerwould deny or (more probably) ignore his request for more funds. Hecklerhad previously sat on an urgent AIDS funds request for six months doingnothing; in that period of time, 500 more people had died of AIDS.________________________________________________________________________SO, BE SURE TO VOTE ON TUESDAY, & VOTE YOUR HEALTH, YOUR RIGHTS, & YOURCONSCIENCE AS WELL AS YOUR POCKETBOOK!Cheers,Ron Rizzo""Why, dahling!

Here's an assortment of infoculled for a couple of articles, sketching a history of the (lack ofa) Reagan administration response to the AIDS crisis.[from NYNative, 8/15-28/83, Larry Bush ""Reagan Response Blasted InAIDS Hearings"", pp. 14-15]By 1983, Reagan administration (RA) response was so inadequate thatTed Weiss (D-NY), who chairs the House Subcommittee for Gov't Opera-tions & Health (HSGOH) which has a mandate to act as ""watchdog"" overall federal health agencies, had to institute hearings just to findout what was going on. Weiss accused Assistant Secretary of HealthEdward Brandt (Dept. of Health & Human Services, HHS) of OBSTRUCTINGHSGOH investigtion of AIDS crisis response by the Centers for DiseaseControl (CDC) & the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He noted:-- an NIH memo which asked all employees, including scientists,to allow interviews only if a top Reagan health officialwas present, something that would clearly have a ""chillingeffect"" on the interviewee.-- that both CDC & NIH withheld research proposals & resultsfrom HSGOH.Brandt countered:-- HHS wished to protect employees against ""intimidation"".Yet many government scientists have indicated a willing-ness to talk publically, except when ""intimidated"" bytheir boss, the Reagan administration.-- HHS wanted to protect confidentiality of research subjects& victims. This defense is particularly ironic: this fallover 300,000 blood donors to a project to study the extentof HTLV3 in the population were informed AFTER THE FACT thatHHS could not guarantee confidentiality (that insurancecompanies, employers, etc. would not get hold of the info)!In addition, US Statute law governing epidemics seriouslyviolates confidentiality & other ethical cornerstones ofmedical practice & civil rights. The HHS is certainly awareof this: confidentiality is thus not a ""cornerstone"" ofCDC operations.Brandt's defense was feeble (a characteristic of RA reaction to criti-cism & demands throughout the AIDS crisis).Republican members of HSGOH echoed Reagan's overdue declaration that""AIDS is our number one health priority"" and sophistically went on to saythat that ""doesn't make AIDS the number one funding priority"". (In fact,AIDS funds were very low among HHS funding.)18 months after federal AIDS effort began, no new information on the epi-demic was available from HHS. Yet non-HHS sources regularly announcednew statistics, facts, & research results during this period.Virginia Apuzzo, of the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) testified:The Reagan Administration was in the absurd & outrageous position offollowing, not leading, not only the scientific community, but the generalpublic, in what is precisely what HHS & CDC (& even NIH) were created todeal with: national medical emergencies, particularly complex & intractableones, whose scope swamp private & academic medical resources.Steve Endean of the Gay Rights National Lobby (GRNL) pointed out the situ-ation's even worse than that: concerned organizations & even the legisla-tive branch HAD TO LOBBY HHS & the executive branch to get them to moveon resolutions they'd already adopted, to make crucial already due decisionsabout rudimentary matters, or even to get any information AT ALL about theHHS AIDS effort.Others who testified commented on the extremely inadequate funding theadministration budgeted for AIDS.Stanley Matek, the previous president of the American Public Health Assoc.testified: ""The administration's marching order to these [AIDS effort]program directors is unequivocal: `Don't ask for any money; make us lookas good as you can with what you've got.'""Bruce Voeller, NGTF founder, & member of 2 scientific advisory panels onAIDS created by the Reagan administration, charged: ""HHS has not conveneda single national meeting of research scientists & physicians from theprivate sector [where most of early work on AIDS was done] & gov't tocollaborate in developing a comprehensive master plan.""Voeller said the administration effectively gagged researchers: ""Those ingov't quite reasonably fear quick termination of their gov't careers ifthey state their considered scientific beliefs in the face of explicitgov't gag orders. University researchers equally clearly tell me thatthey fear gov't reprisal if they appear before these hearings or speaktheir minds. These women & men are dependent upon gov't research grantsin order to carry out their scientific research.""Marcus Conant, codirector of SF's Kaposi's Sarcoma clinic & a physicianat U of C said: ""I have to characterize the federal response to AIDSas bordering on the negligent....I cannot help but conclude that federalofficials who say that enough money is being spent on AIDS are simplymouthing some required political line that has nothing to do with real-ity.""CONTINUED: MORE ON REAGAN & AIDSCheers,Ron Rizzo""Why, dahling!

A recent example of this is a written state-ment Reagan gave to the publishers of PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORE-CARD & published there in August.Reagan's statement read:""Society has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression ofthe bond between a man & a woman. It is the means by which familiesare created & society itself is extended into the future. In theJudaeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband & wifeparticipate with God in the creation of a new human life. It is forthese reasons, among others, that our society has always sought toprotect this unique relationship. In part the erosion of thesevalues has given way to a celebration of forms of expression mostreject. We will resist the efforts of some to obtain governmentendorsement of homosexuality."" [from NYNative, 9/10-23/84, quotingNYTimes, 8/18/84]The SCOREBOARD followed the text of Reagan's speech ""with a 3-pagearticle detailing their objections to gay rights, among which werethe supposed `facts' that the average gay has had more than 500sexual partners (usually anonymous), that most gays admit to rimmingbefore the age of 20, & that 37% of gays engage in sado-masochism.Attributing its information to Alert Citizens of Texas, SOCREBOARDclaimed that, at bathhouses, gays usually have sex with at least10 & sometimes up to 30 partners a night--anonymous, of course--& that, although only 4% of the total population of the US is eithergay or bisexual, gays make up a sizable percentage of venereal dis-ease cases: 72% of AIDS; 35% for hepatitis; 51% of throat gonor-rheas; & 53% of intestinal infections. According to the SCOREBOARD,AIDS in children is caused by close contact with homosexuals."" [quotedfrom NYNative, 9/10-23/84]Can gay apologists for Reagan continue to claim that he is not person-ally bigoted when he voluntarily issues statements like those above toorganizations as virulently bigoted & unscrupulous (the ""data"" abouthomosexuality offered would be hilarious were it not part of a serious& well-financed propaganda effort to create & direct violent hatredagainst gays as a group) as PRESIDENTIAL BIBLICAL SCORECARD [sic.] ??Reagan has repeatedly associated not only his administration but him-self with such groups, attending their prayer breakfasts & other events,inviting their leaders to the White House, involving them in his cam-paigns, etc.But this shouldn't really come as a surprise. Paul Laxalt, senatorfrom Nevada & close & trusted Reagan aide, who (I believe) is chair-man of Reagan's reelection committee, & who played a prominent rolein Reagan's 1980 campaign, has for some time now advocated the DEATHPENALTY for homosexuality. (Laxalt is currently under investigationfor alleged multilple connections to organized crime.)NEXT: REAGAN & AIDSCheers,Ron Rizzo""Why, dahling!

Remember ex-Representative Bauman of Maryland, who was staunchlyNew Right, & cosponsored the Family Protection Act? He lost office after beingarrested for sex with a male minor. (He says now he's a gay liberationist.)Nationally syndicated gay congressional correspondent Larry Bush provideda detailed look at this incredible hypocrisy in his Village Voice article""The Gay GOP"" (6/26/84, pp. 19-22):Reagan's opposition to the Briggs Initiative created an ""afterglow"" amongGOP gays that carried into 1981 when the White House sent out ""feelers""to ""some gays...asking for issues he might use to speak against prejudice""(p. 20). Also, Reagan has been quoted more than once as being ""opposed todiscrimination in any form""; his aides thought his appointment of JusticeO'Connor settled any doubts about his fairness toward minorities (19,20).There WERE interesting developments across the country in the GOP: ex-LAsheriff Ed Davis, a brutal homophobe when he headed the LAPD, was ""one ofa handful of Republican legislators who voted for a California gay civilrights bill"" (20). Openly gay men have run (& 2 of 3 won) for GOP & publicpositions in Iowa, D.C., & Louisiana. ""Gay Republican clubs are spring-ing up across the country as fast or faster than gay Democratic clubs"" (20).Yet to the growing despair of GOP gays, nothing has resulted: Reagan stillcourts the homophobic right; he & his appointees publically oppose legisla-tion that would make life at least a little easier for gay Americans (never-mind civil rights legislation) by fatuously invoking ""family values""; & theWhite House & its health bureaucrats have consistently displayed murderousindifference toward, & even resentment of, the AIDS crisis (including Sec-retary Heckler, who's had a much better press than she deserves). I willprovide examples & quotes for all the above in future postings.When Larry Bush wrote his article, GOP gays were pushing to demand thatReagan separate himself from New Right homophobia, planning some sortof statement at the Convention. I've heard nothing nor seen signs inthe Reagan/Bush campaign that anything was accomplished.CONTINUED: MORE DIRT SOONCheers,Ron Rizzo""Why, dahling!

[Background: As police chief, Davis was famous for shoot-from-the-hipremarks like ""Gallows should be set up at airports and skyjackers tried andexecuted there."" Obviously he wasn't serious, but like Reagan's joke, it saida lot about his attitude. He was and still is a right-winger. The LAPD underhim went out of its way to harrass gays, as I recall from news accounts of thetime.] State Senator Davis supported the recent bill (vetoed by GovernorDeukmejian, a fellow Republican) to prohibit employment discrimination basedon affectional preference, because ""it's the right thing to do"".His reelection campaign is amazing. From what I've read, many gays supporthim, as do most Republicans (so, given his district, he'll win easily). HisDemocratic opponent is trying to pick up homophobic Republican support bydenouncing Davis's support of ""fags and queers"". Those are his words, soneedless to say, the Democratic party has disowned him. He has continued inthe same vein, though.

This is about as stupid as the stink raised about Reagansaying submarine-launched missiles were recallable -- if you read the actualquote, his words were ambiguous; they might well have referred to therecallability of the submarines.

Another 27% work in sales and clerical jobs.About half of those surveyed said they were completely out of the closet,with 34% ""mostly out of the closet"" and 3% keeping their homosexuality secret.A representative of the Lesbian-Gay Labor Alliance questioned the reliabilityof the survey, saying homosexuals ""have a lot of economic avenues closed offto them because they're gay."" However, he also noted that many affluenthomosexuals were moving into San Francisco.-----------------------------------------------------------------Just thought people might be interested in this. -- p.rowley, U.

Another factor is that homophobia comes in many forms, and even homosexuals can have some residual homophobia from growing up in a world determined to assume that everyone is heterosexual...Thinking that gay men are all highly educated and affluent is just a softer homophobia - like the antisemitism in prewar Germany grown from the view of Jews as being so wealthy and educated such homophobia could be used against us... just a thought from a lesbian here in sf... maf""",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/BzROAuedoYw/m/wNc4-0Jr8Z0J,,,

Like net.motss, this would not be an *exclusive* group, but flaming on the basis of one's convictions would be prohibited. As an aside, I once had a relationship where the SO in question inflicted (yes, I mean that word) his celibacy on me *after* we had been doing whatever-you-call-it for several months. We remained friends for a while, but I just couldn't handle it. The friendship remained for a few months, and we'd get together less and less frequently, occasionally sleeping together, until it finally fell away. (Not *it*, the relationship!) I saw other men during the final few months, but I can't say that my seeing them was a direct cause of the demise of the original liaison. The few times that this person and I did sleep together after his celibacy announcement, things were really unhappy. In my estimation, I really tried to be patient and understanding (well, most of the time), but he suffered from serious performance problems (jeez, I hate that term). I suppose it was a conflict between the carnal instinct and his religiously founded conviction. To sum up, it just wasn't worth the aggravation. Helen Anne Vigneau Dual Systems Corporation P.S.

They hypothesize that AIDS is transmitted by receiving T-cells themselves from an infected person. This results in the mild AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and asymptomatic forms (ie, ""car- riers""). Full-blown AIDS occurs by receiving T-cells into which the pathogen has injected genetic material. This hypo- thesis is really the first anyone's advanced which feasibly explains the very puzzling selectivity of AIDS. Has anyone else heard anything about this? The US medical establishment as usual seems hopelessly out of it. Gallo's HTLV-III find seems to be declining in signifigance as each month passes. The French see a lot of heterosexual cases traceable to Central Africa. The current NYNative has a long article on the intensive African research that's just beginning, performed mainly by French researchers, but with a half-dozen Americans participating. The author believes that the next 6 months of reports of African research results will dispel once and for all any perceptions of AIDS as a ""gay disease"". The current Native has other AIDS articles that show how complicated the AIDS research picture has grown. One physician in a Florida town with a large Haitian population reports a high incidence of HTLV III and a growing number of AIDS cases. He believes that AIDS is in fact KS, a relatively new or rare form, not the sluggish skin cancer, but one which grows in lymph nodes & never appears externally. His reasoning is that every AIDS patient doctors have thought to test for the internal form of KS has displayed it, even patients who had the ""traditional"" external form of KS as well. The HTLV-III blood test now seems virtually worthless. The Native reports that a large group of people who scored positive on it showed negative results when another more reliable & much more expensive test for HTLV-III was used. Furthermore, due to the lack of a guarantee of confidentiality given to the 200,000 gay men who in good faith participated in HTLV-III testing a few months ago, large numbers are justifiably refusing to be retested & thus seriously jeopardize the study's value. Maybe now the federal medical bureaucracies will begin to take their hippocratic oaths & professional ethics seriously (maybe this will even inspire the ACLU or someone else to take on the barbaric & grossly unconstitutional statutes which pass for public health law in an epidemic, which few Americans know anything about). (So, as many physicians (including Curran of the CDC) advise, DON'T TAKE THE HTLV-III TEST!!!!!!! Its signifigance is UNKNOWN, it may well be WORTHLESS, & leaves one open to serious discrimination & abuse! If you think you have symptoms and aren't well, seek a competent & trustworthy physician (not necessarily easy to do), PREFERABLY a gay doctor, who's AWARE of gay lifestyles & homopho- bia; even then, don't automatically have the test: find out first what if anything it can offer you and how it relates to your com- plaints.

[ data not compiled-- for some reason every answer was different!] [many people also answered the questions 'what is your quest?' and 'what is your favorite color?'-- the search for the holy grail and blue seemed to be the most popular answers] 2) sex 119 - male 31 - female [ yes was not an appropriate response. popular, but not appropriate. As expected, there is a strong imbalance of bodies on the net, mainly because the computer industry is still heavily male oriented. It isn't as bad as I thought it might be, though] 3) Age (male) (female) 6 1 - <20 42 11 - 20-25 38 11 - 26-30 19 7 - 31-35 9 0 - 36 - 40 3 0 - >40 [ the youngest was in their mid-teens, the oldest in his 60's.

Some noteson that name: Syndrome is a technical term meaning we don't know what causesit, or exactly what it does, but it appears often enough that we need a name.AIDS has up to now been diagnosed not directly but by the appearanceof certain opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's Sarcoma.[Incidentally, AIDS-associated Kaposi's Sarcoma generally only occursin Gays, IV-drug users tend not to show Kaposi's but tend to show otheropportunistic infections.]By this time, the immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS has alreadyoccurred and the disease is invariably fatal within a few years. (7000 havealready died.)Now there is a way to detect exposure to the virus that reputedlycauses AIDS, HTLV-3. It is a simple blood test, easy to do and very reliable.It involves antibodies to the virus.Some sample data on the test:Group % HTLV-3 positiveAIDS patients 99.7%pre-AIDS ~90%Healthy Homosexuals (in SF) ~70-80%IV Drug Users [I don't have this one ~50%?]Hemophiliacs required F-VIII ~30%Random Healthy Heterosexuals 0.003%The test is not in wide use, however, for several NON-MEDICAL butrather POLITICAL reasons.The first is reporting. Since no one knows what a Positive signmeans. (Several of the Healthy Homosexuals who were tested AIDS positivelater came down with the disease, but it was a very miniscule percentage.)Do you tell someone? The psychic risk was judged to be too great by some.The second reason is similar. The test was designed to protect theintegrity of the blood banks. Therefore it was suggested to keep a registryof those with HTLV-3 Positive blood (Like ABO and Rh typing) and only use thatblood for research purposes not for transfusion. [It is done now in NY by aconsent form which is confidential.]Well, Gay groups protested vigorously. Look at the data and see why.The test is very good for identifying those with AIDS. But it is almost asgood for identifying homosexuals (at least in SF - other parts of thecountry may vary.) and they feared labeling. Articles could be written onthis alone, but I must go on.The third reason is that people feared that people who may have beenexposed to AIDS might be more likely to give blood (using donation as adiagnostic test) to see if they really have the disease, causing much morecontamination of the blood supply than already exists, especially if thetest is not available in large enough quantities or is not sensitive enoughand misses some HTLV-3 contaminated blood.The variations are enormous, but I prefer shorter articles.Next time: AIDS in Africa, Heterosexual Transmission.--Craig Werner!philabs!aecom!wernerWhat do you expect?

Some of this might make a good followup, but I also don't like monologues and already posted something (a nice article with facts and figures) and yes, you're right, 7000 haven't died, 7000 have been diagnosed. Concerning KS: it is just a tendency, it is after all an opportunistic infection and therefore related to surroundings, and therefore the patients one sees in Manhattan (primarily gay) and one sees here in the Bronx (IV) tend to be different in regards to KS. It's a little stronger than that but I don't think you can blame it all on the difference between the two boroughs. I don't read NY Native - they don't deliver to the Bronx, but false negatives and positives occur with all tests. Immunoassays tend to be very good. They also tend to improve with use, since better antigens are found. According to Gallo, they've gotten the actual False Positives down to near nothing. There is another kind of False Positive however. Remember, even if one comes out truely positive on the test, there is still some debate on what that means. It either means: 1) You have an active HTLV-3 infection and may get AIDS. 2) You had an infection fought it off and are now naturally immunized to AIDS 3) You were exposed to it and now have antibodies to the virus. and theoretically (or at least a few years down the line) 4) You were vaccinated against it. I think I covered the issues of discrimination and abuse, albeitly briefly, since I'm writing this as a net.med article primarily. Therefore, you have to give me the benefit of point of view. I have seen dozens of articles on the social aspects of AIDS but I'm not an expert on that. My expertise is more in the scientific aspects of the disease. Both are important.

I'm sure most of you read a newspaper and/orwatch the evening news. One of the stories going around now is thatsomewhere back east (that is, east of the rockies), there is a 3 yearold kid whose mother gave him herpes at birth by kissing him. Nowthis kid is trying to go to school but it seems that herpes iscontagious so all the other kid's mothers are keeping their kids out ofschool. School officials are trying to avoid spreading the desease bymaking the kid (I'm going to call him Mikey, I don't know his real name)wear clothes over all herpes sores on his body, and if one is on his faceor hands he can't go to school. This isn't good enough for the mother's,they keep their kids out of school anyway. If I had a kid I probablywould do the same.Now imagine how Mikey feels. Here he is, through no fault of his own,destined to be a social outcast during his entire childhood. I'm surewe were all ostracized (sp?) at least once in our childhoods, but thatwas a temporary thing lasting only for a few weeks or months.Can you imagine how it would feel to go to class and find the classroomdeserted, all on your account? One of his teachers even requested, andgot, transferred away from him on account that she has a skin deseasethat made her more susceptible to catching the disease.In school, everything Mikey touches has to be washed with soap and waterbefore anyone else can touch it. This includes desks, pencils, gluecontainers, paints, blocks, fingerpaintings, etc. I'm sure none ofus were ever so disliked that anything we touched was either washedthouroughly or burned.What kind of a person will Mikey grow up to be? All his life he hasn'thad a single friend, in fact just the rumor that he will be somewhere isenough to clear out the area. This kid will probably grow up hatingthe human race, and with good reason. His chances of having a productiveand satisfying life are nil, he will most likely be a violent criminalby the time he's 18.My question is, what do we as a society do about this problem? Mikeyisn't the only kid like this, there are others around the country.Should we send the kid to school and make the other kid's motherssend their kids there too? Should we hire a private tutor for him?Maybe we can have a special school somewhere for kids with herpes,whose teachers have herpes also. Or we could put him in a school forkids with other contagious diseases. I don't know the correct answerbut I think something should be done. The facts are, herpes iscontagious, it can't be cured, and this problem is going to get worseas more and more herpes patients have kids.

As much asI've read in the Washington Post (where the subject is local news), neitherparent nor any of his siblings has herpes. The child has a learning problemthat is unrelated to the herpes and the classes are small but necessary.The school board hadn't thought out all the details before he was sent toschool, and the other parents kept their kids home. It went before a judgewho gave a temporary solution: Mikey must be examined each morning by anurse to determine whether he has sores on his hands. If he does, he must gohome. He must wear a one-piece suit to cover any sores on his body. Hisdiaper must be changed in a separate room by someone wearing disposablegloves.

He has a bigger problemin that he has some learning disabilities that may hold him back more thanthe herpes scare. I bet his parents have tried to explain to him why theother kids aren't there, but he probably can't understand. I think theother parents were afraid that all the details had not been considered beforehe was brought into the classroom. I have problems understanding why mostof the school stayed home. His class maybe (about 7 other children becauseit is special education), but not most of the school.Yes, herpes is contagious. But not all the time.

But Koppel and his ""concerned parent"" guests seemedunbelievably dense. Quoting from memory:1. Most children who catch herpes get it from other children.2. Perhaps 60-70% of the entire population gets herpes by the time theyreach late middle age. The virus is extremely common in the population.3. The vast majority of people who get herpes never show any serioussymptoms.4. Babies are the most likely ones to contract severe symptoms if theyget herpes; older children are much less severely affected.5. Herpes has always been common in children under a different name: coldsores.From this, it became obvious to me that the whole issue was not a Big EthicalDilemma at all, but rather a non-issue which simply required some masseducation. But the show failed to rise up to this level, something thatTV ought to be good at.

""Yes, they told us the samethings we've heard from the doctor here"". ""And what did you think?"" ""Itscared us to death! There are so many people out there to get herpes from!""Incredible.

So I would like to ask, in this globe>>spanning forum, if this kind of thing seems to be more common in California?I suspect that I am risking some flames, but since the question was asked, I'llthrow in my two cents.1) It is not that uncommon for someone who is gay to maintain a cadre of datesof the opposite sex who are also gay for the express purpose of maintainingappearances. I know that on one occasion, a piece of ""juicy gossip"" involveda so-called hot romance between myself and a fellow employee. At that timeI was so buried in the closet that I would never have dared tell the truth.I suspect that some of the female attention shown towards me was a result ofthe image that was created by this arrangement. I suspect that this womanalso had several ""straight"" dates as a result of ""our affair."" Probablyafter one ""comes out of the closet,"" their need to continue such a masqueradeis eliminated (or at least sharply reduced.)2) While an anti-homosexual attitude is still not that uncommon on the part ofmany individuals in our society, I believe that a much more open, realistic &enlightened environment exists today. In years past, it was not that unusualfor a homosexual to marry. (Again for appearances sakes - in some cases, thespouse was actually aware, or at least suspected after awhile that this wasthe case - the spouse (often the straight wife) was sometimes willing (albeitreluctantly) to allow their mate to have their occasional night out on thetown. Before marriage, or when marriage never occurs, many gay individualsgive into the strong societal pressures to conform. Hence, they date eventhough the prospects of marriage (or at least a successful marriage) isalmost nil. While the acceptance of homosexuality is a great deal more thaneven only a few years ago, fear of disclosure is still great enough to makemany gays attempt to present the appearance of normalcy. And of course,there are those who are not sure of their sexuality and hence keep experi-menting.3) In the latter case, not only does the gay individual come out on the shortend, but so do all of the straight dates who are ignorant. (This assumesof course that the gay individual is really gay and not just unsure of theirsexuality, which is an entirely separate issue.) (Also, the notion that youcan ""tell"" a homosexual by some outward signs is usually a myth unless thatperson is a flaming queen or a butch dyke - please no flames over the use ofthese titles - suggest better labels if you can. The fact that the juicygossip re: frequent dates as mentioned in paragraph #1 is evidence that thisis true in at least one instance.)4) Remember, this question was asked in net.singles and I am only responding.Before you flame, ask yourself what motivates you to do so.

Now for those of you who have never been there, Sacramento is not aterribly fun place to be, in fact it is out and out boring. To make upfor this, I spend a lot of time in San Francisco. I have a couple offriends who I've met thru various ways who live in a seedier part of SF.One of the persons who I go to see there frequently is a lesbian. Nowmy frineds here have a terrible time trying to understand how I could befriends with a gay person, and how I could put up with an ocaisional gaytrying to pick me up there. A lot of my male friends here say theywould probably punch any gay that tried to pick them up (they obviouslyhaven't seen some of the gays in SF).Nos the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very littletolerance for gays in this part of the country. There also is the ideathat a) There are VERY few gays outside of SF and b) the entire city ofSF is gay. I know both of these are not true. I know some of myfriends here are gay, and on more than one occasion, a gay tried to pickme up in Bethlehem, PA.So in case any of you thought that Henry was just amking a lot of noisewhen he said that people only thought that gays lived in California andthat there is very little tolerance for gays in the midwest, thinkagain. And for any of you who think the same way, it isn't true. Thereis a higher percentage in CA, but they don't have a corner on themarket.Just making noise.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Andy Banta {decvax!allegra!ihnp4}!pur-ee!pucc-k!agzDept. of Mental Instability, Purdue University --- ""I'm OK, You're a CS Major""------------------------------------------------------------------------------""The dogs follow and the vultures lead.""",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/pGROayrhALg/m/lVt8M9OVW2oJ,,,

In the bay area out here, SF estimates its population to be about35%. Think about that first figure, though-- Even if it is off by, well,10%, and only 5% are really gay, it means that one out of 20 people youmeet is gay. And for the true anti-gay people out there, you never evenrealized it, did you? (Don't tell me you don't know gays, you do, you justdon't know they are gays-- in all other respects that look, think, and actlike all other human beings). If all of your gay friends told you tomorrowthat they were gay, would you stop being friends to them? If so, why? theyhaven't changed, they are the same friend they were before, you know...Gay doesn't mean different, folks. Gay means Gay.

For chronic diseases, it is usually steady. For epidemics, it tends to rise dramatically (as in AIDS) and then fall (something that AIDS has yet to do) Some of the data: Annual Incidence: Year cases Rate/100,000 1978 4 0.002 (in US, total pop. 1979 9 0.004 age 5 and above) 1980 44 0.02 1981 239 0.11 1982 961 0.44 1983 2501 1.20 ->5/84 3096 1.43 Note the nearly 1000 fold increase in incidence. This is clearly a disease in the exponential stage. 1.5/100,000 means 1 in 66,000 Americans has AIDS, or if they were spread uniformly, that would be one for every sellout football game. (That last example is of course, facetious, but illustrative) However, they are not spread uniformly, as seen below: Interpretation follows the data: Group # cases Incidence Single Men (US) 3,752 8.9 SM in Manhattan 1,358 175.5 SM in other NY boroughs 413 37.6 SM in SF 473 204.5 SM in LA 308 44.2 IV Drug Users (US) 1,381 113.3 IVDU in NY 675 203.2 IVDU in New Jersey 188 269.0 Haitians (US before 1978) 27 1.8 (US after 1/1/78) 192 82.0 Hemophiliacs (severe) 33 298.5 (mild) 2 43.2 In female contacts of male IV drug users 26 3.1 Persons receiving blood Adult (> 10 units) 25 4.8 Children(> 10 units) 5 22.5 Children (10 or less) 5 0.8 Comments: Most incidence data have trouble with the reporting of cases. In this case, however, the number of cases is probably more accurate than the population estimate. This reason however, is the reason the incidence is for Single Men, and not for Sexually Active Gay Men (which has been the usual phrasing of the risk group) because it is very easy to tell if a man is single, but much harder (and more controversial) to find out if he is gay, or if he is sexually active (and how would you define that) In fact, 87% of AIDS victims who are single men are gay or bisexual. (Same Source) For IV drug users, NJ may be higher because the estimate for NJ only included heroin users, and for NY and USA included heroine and cocaine. Also, IV drug users are usually less mobile than gays, so pockets may develope Note the numbers for Haitians. The very low number before '78 probably shows that the disease came to Haiti at approximately the same time it came to the US. It might have even spread there from the US. Either way, it means that the island itself is not to blame. For hemophiliacs and blood donors, the data clearly suggests that the disease is in fact spread by blood (though possibly not exclusively) since the risk is related to the amount of blood that the patient receives. There is one other thing not visible from the above selected numbers. Transmission from males to females is much more common than from females to males. It may have something to do with females (tending to have less partners, perhaps?) or it may actually say something about the mode of transmission of the disease. Robert Gallo of the NCI suggested that not just the virus but also infected tissue was necessary for the most efficient transfer of the disease, and sperm contains cellular matter, so it might follow. Of course, the disease can be spread without cells. Factor VIII (for hemophiliacs) is cell-free and has 40 total cases. OK, this article is a little too long.

Hence it would, for similar reasons, passefficiently from men to men.It's not actually gays, per se, it's only sexually active gays, andthey are also highly overrepresented among a whole variety of rare diseases,mostly sexually transmitted ones, but also hepatitis, etc.Also, remember, one of the first AIDS victims back in 1977admitted having over 2000 sexual partners (I think in the previous year alone,but that number may be over several). A few people like that and that's allyou need for a major epidemic.Conclusion: given the mode of transmission of the virus (in blood,semen and saliva) and the fact that healthy carriers can pass the disease,and given the promiscuity of a visible subgroup of the gay population, it'snot really much of a suprise (now anyway that more is known) that gays areoverrepresented among AIDS victims.--Craig Werner!philabs!aecom!wernerWhat do you expect?

If it were that vital for a male to have manypartners, it would be equally important for females to help them out inthis regard. If said sexual promiscuity were vital for the survivalof our species, that is. If it's a matter of intra-species competition,then the argument reduces to ""promiscuous men will tend to have morechildren, who will then grow up to be more promiscuous--if they're male.""And even Lamarck would have barfed at that one.What Mr. Filipski's pseudo-evolutionary claptrap wants to hide is thefact that any differences in promiscuity derive from enforced inequalityof sexual privilege, only possible in a species mentally capable ofknowing and caring who their kids are, and thus of maintaining culturaltraditions of sexual coercion and restriction. Sure, the spread-the-genes argument holds for many polygamous mammals, but only because adominant male maintains an exclusive harem of females and tries toprevent the less powerful males from spreading their genes at all.Humans could have a biological predisposition toward promiscuity (somespecies mate for life and do OK, so it's moot), but there's no rationalevolutionary argument for males-only. The notion that men somehow ""wantit"", ""need it"" or ""do it"" more than women is merely an excuse for thebasest expressions of misogyny, and a miserable one at that.--*** ***JE MAINTIENDRAI ***** *********** ****** 09 Jan 85 [20 Nivose An CXCIII]ken perlow ***** *****(312)979-7188 ** ** ** **..ihnp4!iwsl8!ken *** ***",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/XqUUJHUWaWM/m/z_aLlHtFIeIJ,,,

Paul Volberding and Constance Wofsy called a press conference toreport their findings and to urge ""safe sex"" practices for all SanFrancisco Bay area residents.Volberding recommended that hetersexuals confine sexual activity toone partner, avoid promiscuity and use condoms consistently andcarefully with new partners.""It would be irresponsible not to give early notice to theheterosexual community that sexual contact with persons carrying theAIDS virus appears to put them at a risk for contracting the disease,""Volberding said.The two latest heterosexual AIDS victims [sic, never say ``victim'' toone who has AIDS] brings the total to four of cases outside theso-called high risk category of homosexual men in San Francisco in lessthan one month.One case involved a woman who apparently contracted the disease threeand half years ago after an affair with a bisexual man. Threeheterosexual men with AIDS have a history of sexual contacts withprostitutes, Volberding said.Volberding, director of San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Clinic,said the new cases ""further confirm our concern that AIDS is a diseasethat hetersexuals can develop.

Quoted without permission. ] Newport Beach, Calif. - Scientists have for the first time identified an antibody that inactivates the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome virus in laboratory experiments, a step toward development of an AIDS vaccine, a researcher said yesterday. Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, who headed one of the two teams that announced discovery of the likely AIDS virus last April, said the antibody knocks out the ability of the AIDS virus to infect cells. But Gallo warned that the discovery ""does not prove you're going to be successful in finding a vaccine."" Asked if he believes an anti-AIDS vaccine can be developed, Gallo replied: ""I am hopeful....but it's really hard to say when."" Considerable research must be done to determine whether the anti-AIDS anti- body will destroy the virus in the human body as effectively as it destroys it in the laboratory. Gallo described the discovery while talking to reporters attending a scientific conference in Newport Beach sponsored by the City of Hope Medical Center. He said the discovery, made only recently, has not been reported in a scientific journal. The so-called ""neutralizing antibody"" was identified by Dr. Marjorie Robert-Guroff in Gallo's laboratory at the National Cancer Institute and independently by Dr. Martin Hirsch at Massachusetts General Hos- pital, Gallo said. Reached in Boston, Hirsch confirmed the discovery of the antibody against AIDS, but declined further comment, except to say his findings will soon be published in a letter to the editor of a medical journal -- which he declined to identify -- and will be presented in April during an AIDS conference in Atlanta. The virus attacks a certain class of white blood cells called T-cells, which help the body ward off disease. The virus is called HTLV-III, and was discovered by Gallo and his colleagues last year. It is the third of a class of human viruses called human T-cell lympho- tropic viruses. A closely related virus, called LAV, or lymphadenopathy associated virus, was discovered about the same time by researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. A major question has been whether the viruses are identical. If they are very different, it could complicate the search for a vaccine. But Gallo said yesterday that HTLV-III and LAV essentially are the same despite a 5 percent to 10 percent variation in the genetic code which governs activities of the 104 different types of AIDS virus Gallo said have so far been isolated. It is not yet known whether those genetic differences mean the viruses act differently biologically, he said. If they did, it might mean that a vaccine effective against one variety of AIDS virus might not work against another. But, Gallo added: ""Right now we can't say there's any important biologi- cal difference.""",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/lHC1FRzMpeA/m/6TNi3OZk2KoJ,,,

It was hoped that such a conference and the gravity of the epidemic would overcome medical rivalries between different research teams competing for the discovery of the AIDS mechanism. But, as Mathilde Krim of the Sloan-Kettering Institute said, hopes were dashed when Robert Gallo, discoverer of HTLV-III refused to attend, unable or unwilling to find time in his schedule. The fight to be first to break the AIDS puzzle has caused the creation of three different names for the prospective AIDS pathogen: HTLV-III by Gallo on the East Coast, ARV in San Francisco, & LAV in France. Nevertheless, a French researcher, Jean Paul Chermont of the Pasteur Institute, announced that two years ago he gave a drug he calls HP-23 to a French hemophiliac AIDS patient. Two years later all trace of HTLV-III is gone from the bloodstream of the patient who seems to have fully recovered. HP-23 has not been used on humans before, and is unknown in the US. It is chemically similar to the metal tungsten. Chermont is now administering it to 34 AIDS patients. However, the drug can cause dangerous side effects in the blood system. Apparently, HP-23 kills all of the alleged AIDS virus in the blood- stream. How does it work? When the AIDS virus invades a cell, it must immediately reproduce. It does so by latching on to the cell's genes. HP-23 kills the virus by competing with it: it also latches on to the cell's genes and thus prevents the virus from reproducing. If the virus can't reproduce, it can't spread, & thus AIDS presumably can't develop. However, the scientists pointed out that the drug would not help many AIDS patients in whom the disease is well-advanced: once the immune system is destroyed, the virus often disappears, its damage done. Many AIDS patients reveal no trace of the virus. Thus, the drug would seem to benefit primarily pre- or early AIDS cases.

First of all, this was a movie based on a BOOK. ""Consenting Adult"" was written in 1975 about the time period in the *1960's*. Thats why things seemed to be a little out of date. I think only a few things were changed to bring the story into the 1980s (there were other story changes, but these don't deal with the time period). One change was the reference to AIDS and another dealt with the bar room scuffle (originally the Stonewall riot). I agree with you that TV seems to go out of its way to avoid showing affection between two men. I agree with you that the characters they chose were ""sanitized for your protection"". But what do you expect from TV that gives us a view of reality such as ""Dukes of Hazzard"" (sp?). Maybe they really do drive that way in Hollywood 8-). I can't say that I look to TV for anything but entertainment and certainly not for a look at reality. I wish they (TV producers) would present a more modern view of homosexuality, however. But I am not holding my breath. Lastly, I liked the show. At least something on the subject of homosexuality was aired. There is such a vacuum on TV about this subject that this show was a welcome relief. However, I do agree with you that it could have been better. -Jim Griggers NCR Corp.

Our conclusion is that AnnLanders is off her rocker in at least 2 ways.(a) My wife argues against the 72% conclusion, saying that sex is better,but were I to develop permanent impotence for whatever reason, she wouldhave little problem giving it up. I argue against the 72% conclusion, too.Count 2 votes for option [1] above.(2) AL's sampling technique is completely bogus. The only people who wouldrespond to such a survey are those who have a *really strong feeling* oneway or the other. That survey is unlike this network, where responding to asurvey requires nothing more than the same medium used to see the question,that is, a terminal. No; to respond to AL, you have to get a postcard, writewords on it, find a stamp (now let's be honest, netters: how many of youknow where there's a 20c stamp in your house right now? :-), get to a postoffice, and mail it.That means that only those who are really motivated to one side or the otherof the question will answer. Now, of those for whom the response would havebeen ""sex over hugs"" (i.e., the 28% conclusion), how many would be somotivated as to write AL a postcard? *My* wife certainly wasn't. (Maybe youor your wife was, of course...) Considering also the number of women whom ALquoted with complaints such as being raped 5 times a week by their husbands,it seems to me that those for whom the response is ""hugs over sex"" areconsiderably more motivated to their side of the question than are those ofthe ""sex over hugs"" persuasion.It was a pretty stupid way to conduct a survey.

I really would have preferred a hug to the sex i wasgetting at the time.there were a few times, however, when sex was exactly what i wanted.it took me more time than anything else to acknowledge that it wasOK to have a sex drive (and an annoyingly high one at that), and thatit was OK to indulge it once in a while as long as i was careful notto get (or spread) any disease and didn't hurt anyone.i find that my sex drive gets higher when i'm depressed, and i thinknow that has to do with wanting the reassurance of someone holding meclose for a while.i've found, though, that i do prefer a steady boyfriend and a moremonogamous relationship (i'm just getting started getting involvedwith someone, so i am seeing other people, which feels strangelyforeign to me because for so long i have been a total monogamist (inbelief when not in practice -- i gave myself hell for anyone i sleptwith that i wasn't in love with), but i learned what can happen toa potential relationship if it gets too deep too fast). i want thingsto go slowly, and i don't want any real pressure yet.also i think i can understand why more women would prefer a hug to sex.many men are out there to get *their* rocks off, and really don't caremuch about the other person, be they male or female. I have had somewonderful sex partners (mostly the ones where a mutual concern for theother person's pleasure was apparent, but not such a dominating factorthat they forgot to have fun too), and i have also had a few peoplei wouldn't trust to screw in a lightbulb after extricating myselffrom their presence. While i am no 'fem' (i just consider myself anormal, average person who happens to be gay) i am constantly annoyedin particular by the 'butch' attitude -- 'I don't do that', or ""youcan do anything you like. just don't expect me to reciprocate."" (myfirst boyfriend told me that. i stayed with him for a long timebecause we were both young (high school), each others' first, andbecause i was too stupid to see he was being selfish and inconsiderate).i guess what i'm saying is what i said in the first paragraph. it'snice to have both, but i can really understand the 'hug > bug' view-point, seeing as how i held it for a while. it seems that you haveto know which you are looking for at the time (or if you are lookingfor both). once you know that, you can go from there and willprobably be more satisfied with whoever you find.larry...--uucp: ..mit-eddie!cybvax0!cci-bdc!larryarpa: hen...@mit-mc.ARPAThis mind intentionally left blank.",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/3In8D3Zz864/m/VVveFsScUJQJ,,,

I'm very happy for those who have awarm, loving relationship that is stable. I have found out thatin the gay world this is a rare commodity indeed.I met Danny five years ago at a friend's Labor Day cookout. Atthe time I was unattached and Danny showed interest, so we talk-ed all through the day and exchanged the obligatory phone num-bers; promising to get together. I had a strange gut feel aboutthe guy but couldn't put a finger on what it was. He was quitehandsome, intelligent (or so it seemed) and charming; almost toocharming as I remember.The following Friday my roomate and I had just sat down to eatwhen the phone rang. It was Danny asking if he could come overfor a while. I asked Lauren if it was ok with him and he nodded.Lauren was just getting over the breakup of a very bad 2 yearrelationship with an alcoholic. He was at the party where I metDanny and also had funny feelings about him but wrote it off asjust his own paranoia about getting involved.In four months I was very much in love and agreed to move inwith Danny. Once I moved in; I started learning a lot of thingsthat would have swayed my decision toward calling it quits withDan. He knew what he was doing all right. He was on his best be-havior until he knew I was his. I first learned he had herpesfrom his brother whom I had become good friends with. His broth-er also told me about the pathological lieing, alcoholism, andpsychotic episodes the family was target of. When I tried talk-ing to Dan about his brother and my conversations; he blew up!Dan told me that his brother was schizoid and had been put awayfor two years. He managed to convince me this was the truth soI avoided his brother for a while. I learned in time that everyword his brother Jim told me was 100% fact.I would come home from work to find him quite drunk and in anasty mood. Sometimes he would go out and not return for a coup-le of days, telling me it was none of my business where he hadbeen. He also made a point of buttering up most of my friends andattempted to do the same with my family; who saw through himfrom day one. Mom couldn't convince me that he was no good sincemy emotions had blinded my thinking. I was determined to make thisrelationship work and at times even Danny seemed to want tomake an effort. His efforts were sporadic; one week he was kindand loving, the next impossible to live with.This went on for three years until I started losing my zest forjust about everything. I started drinking more than I should andbecame moody. My performance at the office took a nosedive andI was warned to, ""Straighten up, or else!"" In my entire workingcareer I had always been rated as an excellent worker. I knewthat I was unhappy in the relationship but was afraid to break itoff since Dan had threatened to cause mayhem if I did. He wasalways telling me how insecure I was; it was really him who wasthe more insecure. I made a conscious effort to remove myself fromDan while living with him. This gave me the emotional distance Ineeded to make the important decision to drop out.Danny knew something was up with me. The day I decided to havethe summit talks with him, he came home carrying flowers for meand champagne. I told him how I felt about all the shenanniganshe'd pulled and that things would have to change. He flew into arage, smashing the champagne bottle on the coffee table thenstormed out of the apartment.Two days later I got a call from him. He was crying and beggedto come back. Just for the record; this happened about once amonth, this time being the last. When he knew I was serious hethreatened suicide. He came and picked up his things the follow-ing Saturday. Nothing was said between us and I thought I'de seenthe last of him. Over the next few weeks I got quite a fewphone calls from friends of mine telling me he had visited themtelling about what a rotten person I was, about my psychotic ep-isodes and my alcoholism. He also called the office and told myboss that I was gay and he was my lover. We had taken some Pol-oroids of us in bed when we first met. I never thought to lookfor them. I got a call from my mother who was very upset. Youguessed it; he had sent the pictures to my mother. The guy wastrying his best to ruin me before he left. The phone rang at allhours of the night with just silence on the other end. I calledthe police who just laughed about the two fags having a lover'squarrel. This went on for two months, until a friend of his drop-ped by to visit. He told me Dan left for San Francisco the daybefore and that he had many questions about Dan himself. We satup until four a.m. and I learned a lot more about the character.I had met an ex-lover of Dan's once. I knew he lived in Bostonand gave him a call. He was only too happy to have me over totalk. The story of his year with Danny was a carbon copy of whatI was going through. After Dan finished trying to ruin Ralph, hehopped a plane for Chicago; two years before meeting me. Dannytold me that he had always lived in Massachusetts when we met. Ilearned that he had lived all over the country, raising havoc withevery life he touched, then moving on.That's one of my stories. It seems very similar to ones thatfriends have told me about past lovers. I swear there must be afactory somewhere in Detroit that manufactures these people.Now ole Jason will share some hints on how to recover from suchan affair.* The two of you have had the same serious fight for the 175 thtime, you've broken up 3 or 4 times and things always seemedto be better for a few weeks after you got back together butyou don't feel like you can handle another round. Fine! it maybe time to part company. If the guy is sane, then the two ofyou can shake hands, hug and fade into each other's history.You might even go on to become bosem buddies. If he's at alllike Danny, read on.* If you fear that your lover may be violent when you break thenews that it's over, have a friend nearby who is willing totake you in for a while. You may want to tell him in a semi-public place where there are other people present; preferablynot a bar.* Warn your friends that he may be dropping by to tell his taleof woe. If they're really your friends you won't be hearingwhat a hot lay he was from them. They probably will show himthe way to the door.* You may also be hearing from his friends after the breakup. Bevery careful on the phone when talking to them; he may be lis-tening on an extension and trying to get the goods on you. Bepolite but brief unless you really know his friends better thanyou knew him.* He may try to contact your family; giving all the sordid det-ails of the relationship. If you're not out to Mom, this maybe a good time to come out gracefully to her,""Uh! Mom, you know myroomate Larry, weeeelllll there's something I've been wantingto share with you about him and I"". She's probably figuredit out after visiting your one bedroom apartment anyway.* Once the bum's out get his keys back, then have the lockschanged. This is very important if your now, ex is anythinglike my Danny. It can ruin your whole day to come home fromwork to find only a lone coffee table in the living room, theone he smashed the champagne bottle on. Also have the phonenumber changed; preferably to an unlisted one. This will helpkeep harassment to a minimum via the phone.* If you're afraid he'll call the office, it helps to be out toyour boss. I was working for a woman at the time when I warnedher about Danny calling. She told me that she had dated a guymuch like Dan and that she'd take care of the twerp. What shedid was cruel but I loved it. He called her as I feared hewould. My boss just said,""Oh really, uh huh, uh huh, well I'msleeping with him now!"" She told me Dan hung up post haste. Ifyou're not out to the boss you can always warn he or she that anescaped lunatic may call claiming to be God. It just helps towarn the boss that some slightly deluded individual may calland to ignore them.* Make sure all your valuables are in a safe place like at Mom'shouse when the shit hits the fan. Take inventory of all valu-able receipts, titles, bank and check books, etc and put themsomewhere out of reach. Go see Mom again.* If he's left anything behind, don't throw it away for a while,at least until you're sure he's gone for good. He may be backlooking for his stuff later and raise a real stink if you'vecanned everything.* If you own anything jointly, get an agreement in writing of whogets the property. You can only do this if the ex is rationaland isn't carrying a gun. The same goes for money in jointsavings/checking accounts. Better still, if the two of you hav-en't been together for an appreciable length of time, thenseparate accounts are a wiser decision. Users will usually press-ure you from the beginning to pool your resources; beware!* If he starts pleading to come back and you've been through thesame melodrama with him before, be firm in letting him knowit's over but don't threaten, ""If I see your fucking face ar-ound here I'll kill you"". This will only get the turkey upsetand start him gobbling all the more. Try to let him think thatthere may be a chance in the future (like the year 2013) thatthe two of you may be able to make a go of it again. These guysdon't handle rejection very well, much worse than the rest ofus.* Another ploy he may use is the,""Let's just sleep together onetime"" routine. It's wise to just say NO! With your jumbled upemotions, you'll probably take him back again for the 147 thtime and wind up where you started. Remember that this guy canprobably read you like a book and play you like a piano. Beingfirm will let him know in a very short time that you mean bus-iness. You have seen through him and he's aware that othershave also. He's terrified of going it alone again because hemay not be so lucky landing another sucker in the future. He'llbe forced to face himself and users don't want to do that; dothey. Resist the Siren's song at all costs.* Well! you're all alone now in this big apartment, right! Takemy advice and don't go rushing out to fill the void with an-other warm body. Nature abhors a vacuum and so do newly part-ed lovers. You're very vulnerable now and risk attracting aneven worse turkey. These users/losers can smell an easy markten miles away and will try sweet talking their way into yourlife. It's now time for you to take stock of yourself. Chancesare that when the two of you were together, you didn't have muchtime for yourself. Indulge in a hobby, call a long neglectedfriend over for dinner, take a night course, etc. The import-ant thing right now is to fill your time with things you enjoydoing.* You may go through a period of promiscuity where you'll screwanything that stands still long enough. This is fine as longas it doesn't become a habit or depressing. Make sure you'renot looking for the deep loving sex you had with what's hisname while sowing your wild oats. Whoring around has becomesomewhat of a hazard with the advent of AIDS. If you don'tfeel good about being a slut for a while, then don't!* You may try getting involved with a gay social group if there'sone convenient to you. This will offer you a non bar socialoutlet, unless the ex shows up; then go back home and watchDynasty. Chances are that the ex will move off to places un-known; especially if he's like Danny.* Allow yourself to mourn the loss of a relationship. You'veprobably put a lot of effort into it and it's ok to feel badeven though the guy was a loser. After a while you may feelanger, even rage when you realize the ride you were taken on.It's ok to be mad. Call up a friend and let him know how youfeel. If the bad feelings become obsessive, call a shrink ifnecessary. He'll let you be angry and might give you one ofthose foam rubber bats to smack the chair with in effigy toyour ex.* I find that working with people who are hurting worse than mehelps get my mind off my own loss. It might help to volunteertime manning a hot-line, visiting the elderly or doing volun-teer work with handicapped people.* Now is also a good time to stay away from alcohol and drugs.They may make the hurt go away right now, but only prolong itin the long run.* If you've had a continuous track record of Dannys, then it'snow time to do some serious soul searching into the reasonsthat you attract these losers in the first place. Are you anemotional masochist, are you too nice and trusting a person?These guys will walk a mile to attach themselves to people likeyou. This may be the time to be a little more cynical, as badas it may sound. Friends may be able to add some insight intowhy a nice guy like you attracts these jerks.* If Mr. loser disappears into a black hole somewhere, don't beafraid to look up an old ex of his or chat with his friends.This isn't prying so much as it is therapy. They may share in-formation with you that will help you get over the ex in a muchshorter time. It's ok to reality test.* Lastly, I hope you learn from your mistakes as I have. I'm muchbetter off because of Danny. The relationship with him taught memany valuable lessons about what I do/don't want out of life.* When you do meet who you may think is Mr. Wonderful, don't rushinto the vine covered cottage after 2 weeks. Take time to get tohim as a friend, date, court; it can be lots of fun and when thetwo of you decide to bed down together, much more satisfying.Even if the two of you never sleep together, you may have gaineda valuable new friend. Remember you may not have a lover but youcan never have too many good friends***************************",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/jEiUB6g9h84/m/MnUgb5gzGpkJ,,,

Well, a copy of ""Forumo"" recently passed through my hands, so I thought I'd mention a bit more about it. The focus of ""Forumo"", as you might expect, seems to be an international perspective on gay rights and culture. The issue I saw included brief news articles on gay issues translated from various national presses (an article on gay rights and the U.S. Supreme Court from ""Time,"" for instance), references to gay matters in the mainstream Esperanto press, an AIDS update, a bit of news from the British gay bar scene, and a couple of poems. A great deal of attention was paid to the gay scene in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, including an article on gay terminology in various Eastern European languages, an informal report on gay activity at a resort in Yugoslavia, and the first in a series of excerpts dealing with gays in Poland from the Austrian book, ""Rosa Liebe unterm Roten Stern"" (""Pink Love Under the Red Star""). As in any Esperanto publication, there were a number of ""volas korespondi"" ads for pen pals; the majority of these came from Eastern block countries. One of the main functions of ""Forumo"", therefore, appears to be to provide a bridge between relatively isolated gays in Soviet-bloc Europe and the relatively open gay scene in the West. Partly so it can achieve this, ""Forumo"" is printed in a small format and is just a few pages long, allowing it to be sent by letter class rather than as a periodical. It also seemed to be rather circumspect in appearance, not printing anything that could be called pornography or that would be certain to upset a non-Esperanto- speaking postal censor. If any of you are interested in the experiences of gays in Eastern Europe, ""Forumo"" seems to be a way to find out more. Subscriptions cost three British pounds per calendar year (four or five issues) and can be ordered from the secretary of the LSG: Mr. Peter A. Danning G/f, 68, Church Road Richmond (Sy) TW10 6LN Great Britain I have also seen a copy of a similar publication put out by Geja Emancipi^go, another gay Esperanto organization. It was somewhat less serious in content, about half of it consisting of sexually explicit photographs.

It describes thefeelings that at least some of us have toward gay liberation._________________________________________________________________________A_Disturbed_Peace__Another Egypt_by Brian McNaughtThese can be dark and dreary times for many gay men andlesbians.For some of the people in our developing community, the eventsof these days even prompt moments of despair; of angry denunciations ofbeing gay; of periodic longings for the security of the life they""remember"" having before coming out of the closet.The reasons for these feelings of anxiety are numerous andcertainly understandable. Some of us, for instance, live in cities inwhich 60% of the beds in our hospitals' intensive care units are occupiedby persons with AIDS. We've lost good friends. We live in fear oflosing others and of contacting AIDS ourselves. We're confused andalarmed.Some of us live in states where moronic legislators speakcarelessly of quarantining us in the public interest. Our localauthorities seek to close our bathhouses and, though we are not patronsof the baths, we wonder where they will stop. We're frightened and angry.Some of us make our homes in places where our neighbors and ourassociates voted overwhelmingly to rescind our rights to employment.Some of us go to schools where straight students have sold hundreds of""Fagbuster"" sweatshirts. Some of us live in towns where anti-gayviolence is dramatically on the rise. We're shocked and we're depressed.""Why did we ever leave the closet?"" some of us ask. ""What didwe accomplish by coming out? At least we were safe when we pretendedto be straight,"" some of us argue. ""Even if it wasn't a perfect life,it was better to be safe passing for straight than to die out of thecloset.""If we gay people listen carefully, we can hear other voicesecho our anxiety.When the Jews left Egypt, many of them did so with mixedemotions. They were excited by the sense of independence andself-determination which Moses promised them, but they were alsofrightened of the unknown. When they realized that Pharaoh and his armywere rapidly pursuing them, some of them yelled at Moses, ""Why did youdo this to us? Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Did we not tell youthis in Egypt when we said, 'Leave us alone. Leave us serve theEgyptians'? Far better for us to be the slaves of the Egyptians than todie in the desert.""Moses was probably hurt and confused by the frightened and angryresponses of his people. Had he made a mistake in leaving Egypt? Wasit better to be a slave? Why had he left in the first place?It was the voice which led Moses out of Egypt, and it was thevoice in which he ultimately placed his trust. The voice that which ledMoses and the Jews out of slavery is the exact same voice whichwhispered a dream to Martin Luther King, Jr. The voice which led anentire nation of Jews into a 40-year wandering in the desert is the samevoice which led Ghandi to burn his English-made clothes, which ledCaesar Chavez to politically organize his family and friends in thevineyards of California, which led Margaret Sanger to defy the law byproviding birth control information to women.The voice which speaks is the voice of God, which is the voiceof life, which is the voice of self-affirmation. Moses heard the voicesay, ""I am what I am."" Albin clears the stage in _La_Cage_Aux_Folles toproclaim ""I am what I am."" The voice within is a constant but generallysubtle longing to live life fully and equally; to live lifeauthentically and to die knowing that you have bloomed to your fullpotential.The voice within is the persons best friend. It is also atroubleraker. The voice within sings an anthem of independence.Listening to it can prompt you to do and say things you never imaginedwere within you. Following its call to action can create all sorts oftrouble. Family and friends will say ""You've changed."" Employeers willget nervous that you are getting out of line. Priests and rabbis willbegin warning you of the sins of pride and reminding you of the perilsof heresy.People who listen to the voice almost always lose the securitywith which society had rewarded them for staying in line; for staying inEgypt; for staying on the plantation; for staying in the closet. Whenyou listen to the voice within and decide to leave Egypt in the hope offinding a homeland, Pharaohs chase you with their armies, voters takeaway your rights, college jocks mock you and people call you names like""militant,"" ""radical,"" ""avowed"" and ""troublemaker.""There is no story in the history of humankind in which peoplehave listened to the voice within without suffering. All growthrequires pain. Any time people have demanded that the world make roomfor their being, society has responded with the likes of Jerry Falwell,Jessie Helms, Cal Thomas and the other Pharaohs with whom we currentlydeal.Likewise, every time there is a troublemaking move out ofcaptivity into liberation, there have always been and will always benagging doubts, fears and anxieties among the liberated and among thosecalled to liberation. Surely there were Jews who stayed in Egypt justas there are women who curse feminism and as there are closetedhomosexuals who hate the Movement because it threatens their security.For every gay man or lesbian who has left the closet but at times wishesthey hadn't, there are black people in history who periodically wishedthey hadn't left the security of the plantation and Indians who wishedthe English had not granted their country its independence.Self-determination is an awesome challenge and it is natural to feeldoubts and fears.Our generation has been tapped to lead the modern liberationmovement while at the same time cope with the horrors of AIDS. Previousgenerations have been tapped to cope with the horrors of the Crusades,the Inquisition, the Witch Trials, the Holocaust and the McCarthy Era.All of them died in the desert rather than serve the Egyptians. All ofus will probably die before the others reach the Promised Land, but themovement forward will continue, even if, at times, it is an undirectedwandering.Though these are dark and dreary times for many gay men andlesbians who periodically think of the ""comforts"" of the closet, thePharaoh and his armies are still not enough to keep the people incaptivity. ""I came out at the beginning of this year,"" wrote a55-year-old stranger to me in a letter to me yesterday, ""by telling mywife of 23 years and my two sons (21 and 22) that I am gay. I movedinto an apartment. I have a very special friend with whom I hope alasting relationship will develop. After so many years of livingstraight and being gay, I have now found a peace which I neither knewwas possible nor had any hope of achieving.""Welcome to the desert, friend.________________________________________________________________________I, and perhaps many of those gays who profess to be Christian,have this feeling that the Christian/Jewish God is our God, even thoughwe seem to see a whole different aspect of Him than the right-wing edgeof Christianity. It is often my feeling that that group of Christianswho deny others the right to be Christian in their own ways don't reallyunderstand what/who this God they worship is, and therefore end upstanding in His way. And that is the reason many gays (like me) spendlong hours trying to convince Christians that they should not fear us,but should be standing in the trenches beside us working for world whereeveryone has the right to be themselves and free.--Richard A.

Therefore, I find itunbelievable that He would ask me to give up loving Steven, since thiswould be a distinct contradiction of his message.>I must ask myself this question and if there is, well, let's build>a statue and shrine because we will have discovered our god.>I do not fear you, but I can not call you brother, for you are not of>the same Spirit.Then you do not understand the ""Spirit"" as I do either. By stating thatI am not your ""brother"" and that I am not of the ""same Spirit"" you arebeing rather judgemental. As I recollect, Jesus taught that all men are""brothers"" (all people are children of God), not just Jews (there wereno Christians at that time). This seems to indicate that although youcall yourself a Christian, you think that Jesus was a liar. Is that thecase?>If we say that we have no sin, we lie and do not the truth ( I John)I have not made any statement of the sort that I do not not sin. However,my sins are between me and my God, and have nothing to do with you. Makesure you do not have a log in your eye before you start trying to pick themote out of mine.--Richard A.

You can contract AIDS (HLTV-III *isn't* the same thing...I know. What is the current view of it's relationship to AIDS) by a) sexual contact with *someone who's got it, and got it from a sexual episode contact with a partner of either sex who got it from a sexual contact of their own, or one of the things listed below) b)a blood tranfusion-you are notably at risk if you are the sort of hemophiliac who requires unfiltered (uncentrifuged?) blood to preserve some kind of clotting factor c)an intravenous drug user who shares needles with one of the people listed above (or another ""c"". Yow! this is recursive) d)some other form of contact that allows for serum-vectoring of the infective agent (an immunologist at the last party....). The little clause in a) suggests some bias, I know. I'll rephrase James' soapboxing here: That a singly-bonded relationship that is mutually faithful -whatever the affectational orientation- is not at risk. Now.

He claimed to have notshowered for three days and was seriously physicly abused. He was laying nakedon the bed as I rubbed his back. Funny! he smelled as fresh and clean as ifhe had just showered. There were also no marks of any kind on his body. Heclaimed to have been seriously anally abused. If this had been the case, thenhe would not have let me touch that area; instead he layed there moaning andgot quite aroused. I would think that anyone who had been through what he hadwould not even want to think of sex, but he was ready and willing; Hmmmmmm!Didn't hit me then since he was playing on my sympathies and I felt bad forhim.

(Under which they keep theirGrateful Dead albums.)Yuppie residences contain all sorts of modern furniture.Gruppie residences contain the same furniture used back when they werein school, loaned (?) to them by their parents.Yuppies eat Le Menu's cooked in their microwaves.Gruppies eat only that which is ""organic"".

Anti-AIDS drugs promising. Intensive research over the past year has produced at least six drugs that show early promise in treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). These drugs are significant because they attack the virus itself, rather than merely treating the infections and malignancies associated with the disease. Five drugs are now being tested in AIDS patients, the sixth is undergoing in-vitro study. Each of the agents acts by interfering with the replication of the AIDS-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV. [] The most promising drugs are: 1. Suramin. Commonly used to treat sleeping sickness. It is thought to block the cytopathic effect of the virus. Although it can produce severe toxicity in Africans with parasitic disease, it appears well tolerated in US AIDS patients. 2. HPA-23. This drug also is an inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Tested at the Pastuer Institute in France, two of four AIDS patients show no sign of virus one month after receiving the drug. 3. Phosponoformate. MGH researchers have shown this drug has persistent anti-viral action ... Two Swedish patients now are receiving the drug. 4. Ribavirin. This decade old drug, believed to act as a nucleotide analog, appears to inhibit HTLV-III replication in cultured cells. It's exact mechanism action remains unknown. 5. Alpha Interferon. This has previously been shown to be effective against Herpes Zoster, CMV, and influenza. It is furthest along in clinical testing. Stage 2 and 3 trials are planned in Boston, Seattle, and New York. 6. Amsanycin. In CDC in-vitro trials, this drug reduces infective virus by 90%.

And don'tbe rude, except in self-defence. And don't think the less of someone wholooks like he/she wants to ask to do either, but does nothing.Of course, this doesn't cover rude behavior on the dance floor, such aswandering hands and simply walking off, but toadies will be toadies.

I have contributed to the Colorado AIDS Project (CAP) which is a local, non-profit organization which assists persons with AIDS and provides information and education about AIDS to the public. It funds no medical research. Although I realize that medical research is an endeavor which requires ""mega-bucks"" that many say only government can provide, I would point out that the same could be said of cancer research which does, I believe, get significant funding from private donations.

I'de guess that there were 20,000+ men and womenmarching.After the parade my roomate and I held a cookout for friends and we show-ed the tape after dinner. Comments were made regarding where Ray's 12/1 zoomlense found itself looking. Saticon cruising can be fun and it's virus free!How did the marches go in other cities?

""More and More Love"", Japan, 1984, is directly concerned with homophobia and the AIDS crisis. It tells of a popular singer who finds love, a journalist who exposes him, the hysterical reactions of his Christian parents, his fear that he has caught AIDS and his supportive gay friends. The film is a strong indictment of the negative effect Christianity has had on Japanese society. There were a number of long sex scenes (as close to hard-core as you can get without showing genitals), and this might seem inappropriate in a serious film to Western audiences. At the end, there was mixed applause and boos from the audience. I don't think the boos were deserved, but I agree the film had some problems, including a rather exaggerated (and perhaps unfamiliar) style. Directed by Koshi Shimada, and produced by Japan's (supposedly) most visible gay activist Ken Togoh. ""Naughty Boys"", Netherlands, 1983. After the party, six men in evening dress, having strange telephone conversations with remote lovers (in different languages), and remembering earlier dances. A very experimental and slow-moving film. We left about half-way through. ""The L-Shaped Room"", UK, 1962. This was in the ""1960's Britsh Cinema"" series, when British films were beginning to treat homosexual characters in a non-stereotypical manner. (Watching the trailers for some of these was pretty amusing.) Jane (Leslie Caron), pregnant and single, moves into a seady rooming house. She falls in love with Toby (Tom Bell), but their love is complicated by the baby and by Toby's poverty. Among the other boarders are Johnny (Brock Peters - black so of course he plays the trumpet), who is in love with Toby, and various other off-beat characters. Best scene (paraphrased from memory): @begin(MINOR SPOILER) Another roomer (Cicily Courtneidge) is an aging ex-vaudevillian. She reminisces about her one true love. Jane asks a question about ""him"". ""Him? Who do you mean?"" ""Why, your old flame."" ""If you want to, there's a picture of my sweetheart."" As Jane looks at the picture (another actress), and does double-take: ""It takes all kinds, dear."" <<Applause>> Then: ""I hope [the baby] is a girl, dear. Boys are so much trouble."" <<Applause>> @end(MINOR SPOILER) Maltin gives this 3.5 stars, Scheurer (?) 4 stars. I think 3 stars. It's long, and (while perhaps brave for the time) a little dated. It's an interesting look at the period, though, and the characters are also interesting and well acted. ""Horror Vacui-Die Angst vor der Leere"" (Horror Vacui-The Fear of Emptyness), West Germany, 1984. This tells how a young gay student falls into the clutches of Madame C and her cult of Optimal Optimism, and how his more level-headed lover tries to rescue him. This is filmed in a very minimalist and expressionistic style. It concerns how people are willing to bow down to an authority figure who tells them what to do, even at the cost of their own destruction, and has a post-Nazi sensitivity. This is a serious, funny and brilliant movie (""worth 5 bucks and standing in the rain""), directed by Rosa von Praunheim. ""Luminous Procuress"", US, 1971. This film by Steven Arnold was supposedly a major avant-garde success, and got raves even by mainstream critics. It tells how two young men are shown around in a very strange brothel. It's a mostly-straight film. It features the Cockettes, a comedy/drag/musical troupe from then. Most of the film displays elaborate but rather static set-pieces, where nude or outrageously dressed people are part of the scenery. As a futher alienating device, it's all non-verbal: When people are speaking, you hear a voice-over of someone speaking what could be Russian or a nonsense language. There was applause at the end, but I found it mostly boring. Shorts: ""David Roche Talks to you about Love"". Basically a very funny, very cynical and very painful long monolog by Roche. Definitely worth going out of your way for, even if you're straight. Quotes: ""Love is knowledge and acceptance (in spite of the knowledge)"". ""A loves B, who loves C, who loves D, who has a vibrator."" ""The Steps"", an amusing little hommage to Sergei Eisenstein. ""Castro Street"", filmed at Halloween. I found it pretty boring, though many in the audience seemed to like it. Being done in 8mm (at least it looked like it) didn't help. I guess I'm pretty jaded, having been to too many masquerades at too many science fiction conventions to be easily impressed. Earlier I've seen two earlier festival films: ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" (of which enough has already been said in this newsgroup), and ""Before Stonewall - The Making of a Lesbian and Gay Community"" (US, 1984). This is a reasonably good historical overview upto the Stonewall riots. I heard there are a couple of historical inaccuracies (there \was/ an American homophile political group before the Mattachine Society), and sanitizations. A number of other movies looked interesting, but it's a long drive to Mecca... --Per Bothner ARPA: bot...@su-score.ARPA UUCP: {decwrl,ucbvax}!shasta!bothner",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/lTIjOHQCMU4/m/19tmbKXnAkkJ,,,

Marriage is simply a social convention for a public announcementof your commitment. If you have a true commitment, you don't NEEDmarriage to prove your commitment to anyone, including your God. Thisdoesn't mean that you might not WANT marriage. If the commitment is astrong one, making sure the world knows about it is an obviousresponse.The reality is that 1 of 2 marriages ends in divorce. The MTBF of amarriage is 5-7 years. It is obvious that many people don't understandthe difference between marriage and commitment. Marriage is NOT acommitment, but an announcement of commitment. If you expect theannouncement to take the place of the commitment, you're in trouble.Good relationships can work just as well outside of marriage as they doinside of marriage if the couple wants it to. Bad relationships failregardless.As an official statistic in the marriage game, I know from experiencethat many people believe in the fantasy of 'They lived happily everafter'.

I have a friend(although I don't get to see her as much any more because we've both gottenquite busy with other friends and other interests) with whom I have a veryclose relationship. We hug, and kiss, and some of the kisses are not the""friendly"" kind. However, we have *never* been SO's, or even close to it (orlovers either, for that matter). This relationship has survived throughseveral SO's on each of our parts. I think one reason that you don't hear moreabout these relationships is that they can be awkward with your current SO, sothey tend to be kept more private than a real SO relationship. People feardisapproval, both from their SO and from others.Also, they can be dangerous, such as when one of the parties starts thinkingof the other as an SO they could be setting themselves up to be hurt. I had towork through this one several years ago, but somehow the relationship survivedthe strain.I think what defines an SO vs. a friend is agreement between the partiesinvolved and has nothing to do with the actual behaviors between them. Althoughless common now than during the ""free love"" era, it is not unheard of forsomeone to have an SO *and* one or more other lovers. Thus, it isn't as simpleas sexual relations defining an SOship either. I'd say that if you *both* viewthe relationship as an SOship, then that's what it is, but if *either* partydoes not see it this way, then the *mutual* commitment which defines anSOship is not there.--Greg--{ucbvax!hplabs | allegra!nbires | decvax!noao | harpo!seismo | ihnp4!noao}!hao!woodsCSNET: woods@NCAR ARPA: woods%ncar@CSNET-RELAY",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/6XH_uFVwXZQ/m/ojBylSA7TbkJ,,,

However, I spentthe majority of my ""formative years"" in Ohio. Now for the point (aren'tyou GLAD? ;-))I see the Latin culture as being far more physical among (hug and kissgreetings are normal among friends of either/both sexes). The midwestern-American culture is a lot more reserved. Were I to hug a Miami friendof mine in greeting, it would be perfectly normal behavior for ourfriendship, and not at all a come-on. Were I to do the same with anequally close friend in Ohio, we would get, at best, strange looks.So much for analysis of culture.

We're phobic aboutnon-sexual touching (and many are phobic about touching, period).Particularly in industries that are machine-oriented,we need to compensate for the lack of touch in our lives.

Her husband knew of and had met my friend and everyone>who ate lunch in the company cafeteria would see them eating together>every day, alone.Now, this comment irritates me a lot, since I can identify with it firsthand. When I was still a graduate student, I had a female friend, anothergraduate student, who I was very good friends with, but with whom I had no""romantic involvement"" whatsoever. However, about halfway through graduateschool, she got married, to someone who was also a (somewhat lesser) friendof mine. We continued to sometimes goto lunch together; sometimes all 3 ofus, sometimes just she & I (or some other people from her office).However, several people at the office where she worked treated me like I wassome kind of heinous criminal.If you read Miss Manners (which I strongly recommend), you will see thatMiss Manners also addresses this issue, and says there is nothing at allimproper about this; that only recently has it been required that marriedwomen engage in all social activities in conjunction with their husbandas a ""demonstration of marital solidarity"".I think the following assumption:>I still feel these two were a little confused regarding their own desires>since I know that they each were having thoughts of a sexual nature towards>each other, yet doing nothing about them.>>My point here is that if you're 'snuggling' and hugging someone...is the problem here. Unless one of the two people confided in you that thiswas the case, I think it is grossly unjust to question their integrity inthis manner. If they did have such feelings, well, then they did have adefinite problem there... but it is unreasonable to just assume it was so,since I think many people of good morals would consider it so wrong tohave such feelings as to largely discourage them from beginning. I mean,attractions of this sort often do have a rational element to them; and ifyou could be ""turned off"" WRT someone because, say, they didn't believe ingiving aid to starving children in Africa, you could certainly as wellbe ""turned off"" in this sense by the fact that they were married.

Maybe I'ma little old-fashioned, but isn't it possible to think of someone asan SO BEFORE this happens?? I have certainly thought about girls/women(no, I don't want to start THAT discussion again!) as SOs some finiteamount of time before jumping into bed. I can't just jump into bed,it take some serious consideration on my part (and hopefully on hers,too) and THEN I jump :-). My most recent(ly ended) relationship startedout as friends and eventually veered into the SO realm (in both ourviews) before any of these alledged ""lines"" were crossed. I think youbecome SOs when that person means more to you than any of your other friends.YOU ARE SOs WHEN YOU BOTH FEEL LIKE YOU ARE SOs (i.e. have some definableamount of committment to each other). If it takes jumping intobed to make you feel that way, then that's what it takes.> Also, pls. note that I said that SO-ship begins, & not friendship ends.> I am a firm believer that to have a REAL relationship, you must be friends> AND lovers.Amen. My above-mentioned relationship was the most fulfilling to datesimply because it started out as a friendship (a quite long one) beforethe situation changed. I had never known anyone else I went out withas anything but a date/possible SO/SO before. Asking your best friendout for the first time is tough, but not as tough as asking a perfectstranger. I think to really have a successful relationship you almosthave to be best friends as well as lovers. I am reminded of Burt Reynolds'and Goldie Hawn's movie ""Best Friends"" which I only saw a few months agoon cable. When they decided to split up (at least for a while) one of thethings they both found hard about it was not having their best friendaround. Now, admittedly, the characters didn't have too many other friendsbesides each other which would have helped them some, but I liked theimportance the writers placed on being friends with your lover as wellas lovers.In short (which I should have been in the first place, right?), thiswhole discussion (about friendship ending and SOship beginning) isfairly pointless since every person is going to have his or her owndefinition of it.

Iwould tend to place SOship above sex. Certainly many people have sexualrelations with more than one person at a time (not necessarily all partnerspresent at the same time).Is it possible to have several SOs at the same time? If sex defines SOship,then this must be the case for many people. It certainly is possible formany other people to be significant, but I feel that the meaning of SO isone that is 'more significant than anyone else'.Clearly there isn't any clear cut dividing line, as has been previouslystated, so SOship must be defined by each person based on what they thinkit is.

As a veteran of a long-term marriage, I can tell you that relationships like that are often verydeliberate choices. Sometimes they can provide just enough emotionalrelease to make it possible to stay in a less-than-satisfying marriage.Of course it requires a delicate balancing act, and both parties reallyhave to know where to draw the line (and what their spouses will accept.)W.

If problems are there,they have to do with the way people communicate. And believe it or not,there are some multitalented individuals out there who are very good at bothcommunicating and making love.

In these timesthis physical attraction frequently has a sexual expression, though notalways (thank God). It's also the case that many people don't love everyonethey have sex with; on the other hand I think even the most sexually liberatedamong us will admit that sex, in theory a purely physical sensation, canawaken in us certain deep-seated feelings.

The underlying question of much of the current discussionseems to center on what _is_ a Significant Other. The most commondefinitions implicitly put forth seem to define SO as someone with whom oneis both romanticaly and sexually inolved. I would like to offer adifferent perspective.From a psychological view SO is a technical term with a specificdefinition. It refers to _anyone_ who has an immediate, significantinfluence on a person's life. Examples include parents, friends,relatives, siblings, teachers, etc., etc. Note that the relationship neednot include any romantic or sexual aspects. Anyone the person cares about_for any reason_ is an SO.From the above perspective the question of where friendship ends and SOshipbegins is meaningless. A friend _is_ an SO, by definition. The realquestion then becomes one of how much romantic/sexual involvement afriendship can stand or whether it's possible to be friends with a sexualpartner. All of these conditions are subcategories of SOship.----_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-The Polymath (aka: Jerry Hollombe)Citicorp TTI Common Sense is what tells you that a ten3100 Ocean Park Blvd. pound weight falls ten times as fast as aSanta Monica, CA 90405 one pound weight.(213) 450-9111, ext. 2483{philabs,randvax,trwrb,vortex}!ttidca!ttidcc!hollombe",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/6XH_uFVwXZQ/m/HgKjLziM4KMJ,,,

Sometimes it seems to mean""wish to remain together for life,"" sometimes it means ""agreement not todate anybody else,"" and sometimes it just implies some sort of higher-than-average bonding.

Over the years I hadbasically come to terms with most major aspects of my life (religion, politics,philosophy, what brand of Coke I like :-)), but sex was unkown to me.I was the kid at school whom everyone picked on. The butt of all the jokes.The spaz. The geek. The nerd. And frankly, it didn't help my social lifea lot. Anywhere I might be threatened by abuse I avoided, and gained manybenifits and losses. Most of those who picked on me were into sports so Iavoided athletics like the plague, leaving me with a terrible physique.When I worked on math, science, computers, I was in my own little world,safe from ""the bullies"". Thus I ended up being ""a brain"".And girls! Hah! That was the worst part of all.Between the ages of 10 and 14 (approx.) we are meant to learn how to""socially relate"" to those of the opposite sex. The hormones are running wildand we act like fools (usually) the first few times we ever try to get anywhere with the opposite sex. But we are forigiven for our fumbles because itis expected of us. It's part of the learning process. Within a few years,most of those initial problems have faded and we have a reasonable set ofsocial graces from which to work with. That is IF you even went out andpracticed.But no, I was stuck away reading books, and working on computers. (I don'tregret this, but I know that this is what happened)So now, when I finally try to break out of my shell, I'm given none of thefreedom we were given when we were younger (it may not have seemed like much,but it was there, trust me.)I better stop with this train of thought before you start thinking of meas a whiner. I'm not complaining (well, just a little). I just want othersto realize where I'm coming from and to realize that not everyone is associally graceful as they are.

Then we start makingall sorts of assumptions and stop communicating and the friendship goes tohell in a handbasket.On the other hand, if you are able to talk about what is going on and ifyou are able to keep in mind that becoming lovers is not always a stepforward in the relationship. I don't think that exploring the idea of asexual relationship is that huge a risk. Scary, yes, but a threat to thefriendship, no.The scary part (for me I think it is probally a whole lot fear of feelinglike a fool) has often kept me from acting on my desire to be sexuallyinvolved with a friend. In this context by ""acting"" I mean initiating aconversation on the subject. I mean it's no easier to think of an ""openingline"" with a friend than with a stranger. And with a friend you proballydon't want to just walk away if it doesn't work :-)I once spent a whole evening and the better part of the early morningvisiting with a friend talking and listening to music and reading eachother favorite quotes while finishing old bottles of wine. She finallyblurted out ""where do you want to sleep?"". I think it must have takenme a good minute or two (tho' it seemed like *much* longer) to dare to reply.I hoped that it was a proposition but it could have been an inocentquestion.... you can probally imagine the rest of what was going throughmy mind. Later when we talked about it she was very worried that she hadbeen ""too forward"" (isn't socialization wonderful? :-) We were both *VERY*scared. It didn't turn into a long term SOship, partly because we didn'tlive very close together, but it's 6 years later and we are still goodfriends.On the few occasions when I've screwed up the courage to say what I wasfeeling I've been ""turned down"". And I can't say it was pleasant! Butthe friendship survived just fine, even if my ego was limping for a while.Good luck,Doug Urnerihnp4!tektronix!daemon!dougu--Doug UrnerSmall Systems Support Group, Tektronix, Inc(503)627-5037..!{decvax,ucbvax}!tektronix!dougu",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/6XH_uFVwXZQ/m/C9JWgP3vr5MJ,,,

When you get close enough toanother person to hug them, your auras ""hug"" each other as much as yourbodies do. The melting and merging of auras, the positive feedback oflove, life force, chi-energy, spirit, is the kind of experience whichtruly meets your minimum adult daily requirements of ""love"". You mayapproach this level of sharing with almost anyone, but from my experience,the deepest, most fulfilling of intimate sharing is typically onlypossible with your ""soul mate"". I'm referring to a sharing of the mostintense kind, of the type of energy you raise in your body throughpractices such as meditation, yoga, and prayer. Ritual can be a part ofit, but the essential ingredient is transending your raw animal passion(or waiting until it has passed by having ""sex"" first), and focusing onyour ""love"" energy rather than your ""lust"" energy.For anyone interested in exploring this further, I suggest checking outyour local library or bookstore, in the occult or eastern religion section,for information on Tantra, or Tantra Yoga.Sunny--{ucbvax,decvax,ihnp4}!sun!sunny (Ms. Sunny Kirsten)",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/6XH_uFVwXZQ/m/9D6lnwwfrO8J,,,

A lot of hugging went on. Not just between me and themusicians (almost all of whom were men) but among themselves too.(Thinking back to the comments about only talking about members of theopposite sex hugging.) The one thing that happened during theevening/morning that really stuck with me was when one of the men whowas going to be leaving that morning pulled me aside and said that Ishould spend as much time as I could with these guys while they werehere because not only would I make a lot of terrific friends but thatthey really liked having me around and that they needed to be touchedand hugged and to be accepted like that. He said that it really meant alot to them. I saw that he was very right. He admitted that he neededthat sort of thing too. So for an entire evening/night/morning I heldhands with, hugged, and kissed some of the most wonderful caring men Ihave ever met while we talked, played pool, drank, etc. and not once didanyone make a pass at me or say a lewd word (although I was complementeda few times), and not once did I want to make a pass at anyone. In shortit was one of the most wonderful nights of my life and one that I shallalways remember. I have no doubt that it helped me every bit as much asit helped them. Let's face it gang - hug parties are a very good thing.cheers and a great big hug --elizabeth(Lady Godiva)",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/6XH_uFVwXZQ/m/kMDY_RO-eVEJ,,,

There's a groupof people that I went to college with. In school, we were a ""handsoff"" bunch. We've since discovered that hugging can be beneficialfor us all. The women had no problems hugging the men or the otherwomen; it took a while for the men to feel comfortable huggingother men. Now that we are, the love among us is fantastic.It's rather more philia than eros, and it's wonderful.The children of the group insist on participating (they knowa good thing!), and even my cats are much more responsive to meafter I've been with my friends.

I have trouble remembering how many timesI've preformed 'The Act' with women I hardly knew or hardly liked. Sex isjust physics.SO-ships don't have to include 'The Act'. What about the traditional'virgins until the wedding night'? Would you assume that all of these folksaren't SO's before the consumation of their marriage? I think most of thisdiscussion has been viewing SO-ship as though it were a homoginized state,not as an evolving symbiosis.Where is the dividing line? There are many. I've always found it to be anunspoken agreement represented by some gesture such as a look or or a smile,a hug or a discovery by one about the other. The question: ""Do you like AynRand?"" once catapulted me into a very long and intense relationship when Ianswered ""Yes"". A probing conversation had led up to that question, butthat was the clincher.From this I generalize that the dividing line is heralded by gesturesmarking gradations approaching the dividing gesture.

I've used both at differenttimes. Which ever one my self image will support. Once you have it down,it can be modified and applied to other situations besides the persuit ofMOTAS.The 'attitude' internally is one of self-asuredness bordering on an egotrip, but under control. It's a competativeness that's snarling ifprovoked, but protective of all MOTAS--and especially target MOTAS.To support this kind of competativeness, a few things are necessary. First,a foundation for this temporarily huge ego to rest upon. Everybody's gotsome-thing that they are really proud of, and this pride can be used tocharge up the ego. Just put yourself into a pride-loop for a while. Run itas a backround job, and watch your confidence rise!Second, treat MOTAS--especially the target MOTAS as one of two things:either a complete sex object or as a complete non-sex object. One or theother is bound to get their attention and hold it until you make your nextmove. This doesn't mean total disrespect, but a little brashness can beeffective. The key here is that while you're treating them in one of theabove manners, it's easier to think of them symbolically. Thinking of themsymbolically is very important, as it takes fear out of the situation foryou.Once you've raised the problem to a level of symbolism, it's on turf that aprogrammer can handle.

I think it's a little strong to say she ""isn't worththe try."" But it's very realistic for someone like Chris, whose appeal islikely to be his sensitivity and warmth, to eliminate this woman. There'snot likely to be much interest on either side.What a woman is attracted to has far more to do with her childhood than anyobjective facts you could derive through cocktail party chatter: the dynamicsof her relationship with her father and other male images she absorbed at anearly age. When I was growing up in a large family with a very busy father,visiting his office was a great privilege. It was one of the few ways I couldsee him alone. Later when I hit the classic preadolescent struggle with Momfor Dad's affection, the only chink in her armor was her resentment of hiswork. She refused to learn about it or discuss it, so of course I did. Someof my most satisfying acts of adolescent defiance were discussing zoningordinances at the dinner table (how's that for a full-fledged nerd? :-)Today when I go to a party the men I'm interested in are conveniently in acorner, engrossed in some technical discussion. They seldom recognize me,but luckily I can recognize them.

And each is looking for ""somebodyspecial"" -- a man whose ways coincide with her half-conscious images ofmasculinity. When the fit is right, the most unexpected, insignificantthings will turn her on (and the only techniques you'll need will be forself-defense :-)If you are merely looking for a woman, then there probably are some standardstrategies that will help (though don't believe everything you read in thehow-to books.) But if you want ""somebody special"", then the best thing youcan do is learn to telegraph what you really are. Be open about yourself.Make sure your public image matches your private one as closely as possible,and give the right woman a chance to find you while you're looking for her.If you feel the real you is too boring to attract anyone, think again.Think how exciting it is in the early stages of getting to know someone else,finding out all the interesting things they've been hiding from the world.Human beings are marvelous, complicated creatures.Jane Caputo{allegra, ihnp4, decvax, ucbvax...}!tektronix!tektools!janecTektronix, Inc.M.S. 74-900P.O.

It seemed like there were many more spectators than last year, & the mood was livelier (the numbing number of AIDS deaths in NYC in the last half-year & the grim resulting public mood surprisingly cast no gloom at all on the festivities). All the groups that usually participate were there from NY, the northeast, & farther afield, plus four or more marching bands, majorettes, a large Dykes from Delaware contingent, floats, classic cars, and a Mummer's band (which caused a sensation along the parade route down Fifth Avenue) & large raucous following from Philadelphia. One of the high points of the event was Sybil, a guy in a nearly strapless prom dress with a build that would torment an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who alternately flexed & simpered while seated atop a convertible. The meat rack that resulted down by the docks west of the Village was dazzling, as hordes strolled onto the docks to gaze at the New Jersey shore in the brilliant sunlight, as the rally chugged on next door with virtually no audience (the Boston rally was also deadly with its long program of utterly predictable speechifying). An article on an AIDS breakthrough appeared in the Saturday NYTimes: researchers have discovered a gene in HTLV-III that controls (I think) the rate at which the virus multiplies, in a location where no such gene had been expected. This sounds really major: HTLV-III grows at as many as 1,000 times the rate of the cancer-causing (non-AIDS) HTLV-I, for example. A crucial fact about full-blown AIDS seems to be the sheerly overwhelming nature of the AIDS' virus attack on the immune system. The discovery is promising for the eventual creation of a vaccine and even treatment of AIDS patients. Is Craig Werner or any other netters out there willing to post a detailed article?

Well, almost theentire June 21 issue of JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Assoc.)is devoted to AIDS. It would be too much to summarize all the articles(and they do cover almost all issues collectively), so I am just postingan edited version of one of the two editorials.I am also adding net.singles to the distribution for this time roundbecause AIDS can no longer be considered a disease of male promiscuoushomosexuals. (In fact, in my own limited clinical experience, the onlyAIDS patient I have actually had contact with was a young women.)-Craig Werner.-------------------------------------------------------------------The Age of AIDSA Great Time for defensive living.It was the age of overindulgence. It was the age of tolerance foranything in anyone. It was the age of fear of imposing one'sown social values on someone else's. It was the age of thetrivialization of sex. It was the age of anticelibacy. It was theage when early teenage sex was commonplace. It was the agewhen homosexuality came out of the closet and became almostacceptable to those who once found it intolerable. It was theage of easy, irresponsible oversex, abortion on demand,chlamydia, and genital herpes. And it was the age of AIDS.Not since Syphilis among the Spanish, plague among theFrench, tuberculosis among the Eskimos, and smallpox amongthe American Indians has there been a threat of such ascourge. Yet, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)is different from any disease previously seen clinically andepidemiologically. After the torrents of words that have beenwritten and spoken about AIDS, pre-AIDS, and all the rest, isthere anything else to say? Yes, a great deal. Thus, this isanother JAMA theme issue on AIDS, with MEDICAL NEWSstories, MMWR, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, a brief report, a casereport, a special communication, QUESTIONS & ANSWERS, LETTERS,and two editorials, all dealing with myriad aspects of thisgargantuan problem.The Medical community has responded brilliantly to this newchallenge with a rapid outpouring of correct new scientificinformation. The salient points are:1. AIDS is caused by an infectious agent, which has beengiven three names but seems to be a single retrovirus.2. Many (but not all) who are exposed to the virus becomeinfected, but only some (perhaps 5% to 10% per year) whobecome infected ultimately demonstrate symptoms.3. It is possible that cofactors may lower resistance to andpromote infectivity of the virus.4. The virus may be transmitted from an infected personmany years before the onset of clinical manifestations.5. Latency of many years may occur between transmission,infection, and clinically manifest disease.6. Antibody testing of serum samples is a valuable method todetermine who has been exposed to the virus but it does notmake the diagnosis of AIDS.7. A very high percentage of those who develop thefull-blown disease die.8. There is no known treatment for the immune deficiency,and the treatment for complications are variable and inconsistent.:[Two columns on 'The Dilemma of Serological Testing']:[Header: 'The Virus must be contained', ending with:]:Given the small likelihood of the success of this proposal, itmay behoove those people who do not wish to get AIDS toadjust their life style so as to practice living defensively --particularly in the sexual arena. Individuals have the power toprotect themselves more than science currently can. As far aswe know, prevention is fairly simple.1. We should not inject blood or blood products that areinfected by the AIDS virus into another person.2. We should not share injection needles with someone whois infected.3. [Women] who are carrying the AIDS virus should notbecome pregnant.4. We should not engage in sexual activity (oral, anal, orvaginal) with someone who has the AIDS virus.5. We should consider instituting serological testing forHTLV-III before the issuing of marriage licenses.This is a great time to practice sexual monogamy.Editorial signed: George D.

Aside fromstriking IV drug users, Haitians, Central Africans & European hetero-sexuals, more than a few gay victims weren't promiscuous, unlessLundberg means by ""promiscuity"" anything but strict monogamy, not whatmost people mean by that term. Given the long latency of the virus(7 years in some cases of congenital AIDS), even stable sexual relation-ships don't entirely eliminate the risk of exposure, though they dogreatly lower it: either partner may've been infected years ago. I'veheard/read about gay victims who had been in stable relationships foryears, some of whom died without ever being able to explain to them-selves how or why they got it. Some AIDS cases seemingly resultedfrom a single sexual contact, though heightened susceptibility ofindividuals may be involved here.This is NOT to criticize at all safe sex guidelines, perhaps even withina sexually exclusive relationship (Dr. Lundberg is advocating hetero-sexuality when he advises monogamy: it means ""one woman"" )=: ). Every-one, gay & straight, should also maintain their health & keep informedabout AIDS.Making pregnancy or marriage depend on a negative test for HTLV-III isabsurd & fascistic, but is not surprising coming from JAMA.Craig, why print an editorial, particularly that one, instead of a medicalarticle or a simple pointer to the JAMA issue?Cheers,Ron Rizzo",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/iNn_68vSslQ/m/qR9FTqMfm8wJ,,TRUE,"FT128CM02, FT129CM02"

It's in the book about him called JERRY FALWELL AND THE JEWS, byMerrill Simon, '84.Question: ""Would you like to see your beliefs that God is against homosexualitytranslated into legislation?""Jerry's Answer: ""Most of the states have laws which declare sodomy as illegal.However, like adultery, sodomy is a very difficult violation to deal with. I donot want to see government invading the bedrooms of the American people. But Ido want to see America symbolically, at least, positioned against moralperversion. I want the United States to clearly take its legislative positionon the side of the traditional family. I AM NOT IN FAVOR OF JAILING ORHARASSING PERSONS BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. (italics mine)""Now my point is this: Given the 'rise' of the right and the reaction to theclaims of much of the Gay Agenda (parenting, 'lifestyles' flaunting - why doesthe news media alway show some gay geek on roller skates and in a nun's habit?could it be because it 'sells', that is affronts the sensibilities of themajority?? - , access to children and children's sexual rights, gay teachers,gay marriage equal with hetero marriage, minority status, etc.) I think thatyou may find a 'friend' in Jerry!!!Take for instance the extreme right as seen in the novel THE TURNER DIARIES inwhich gays (with Jerry please note) are shot out of hand in the take over ofthe country by the neo-nazis. Granted that's not likely - but then who justbefore Hitler would have thought . . . - with some of the hysteria about AIDS(the whole population at risk!) and the extreme loss of political power sufferedby the gay movement (let's hear from the rest of the country guys, not justMass.) it at least looks like some rough sailing for gays in the future.Now Jerry clearly says homosexuality is morally wrong. Big deal you might say.But note he says to leave you alone basically. So he doens't want to see yougain equal moral status! He doesn't want to see you picked on either. Thatmay be of value in the years ahead. So don't totally disregard him please.Of course we'd never, in this country, round up all the gays like they wereJapaneze, eh? Listen, a few good terror incidents in this country and therego certain civil liberties and rights and everyone says 'good'. ""Papers plez.""These things have a motion of their own. We could get real used to somepretty strong solutions to some 'big' problems real quick. AIDS, one moreattack on St Pat's during a 'gay pride' march - how about a gay coven caughtsacrificing little children a la Ohio, eh?

We finally managed to getinto the third train that went by; they were all jammed to the hiltwith people going to the parade. We managed to get a good position,right before traffic light for a cross street where they were lettingbuses go through, so most of the groups had to stop and wait a bit.The parade started off, as always, with Dykes on Bikes. The groupmust be growing, as I've never seen so many of them before. They justwent on and on. Various political figures followed (Lady DiFi, ofcourse, was not among them), followed by the contingents for thevarious AIDS groups. They got the biggest applause of the day, and Iwasn't alone in being a bit teary-eyed at that point.I won't try to be inclusive, but these are some of the more memorablemoments:Sistah Boom, a feminist political/samba group, really had the crowdjumping. I wanted one of the t-shirts several of them were wearing,""Samba not bomba"".Both the Gay Fathers and the Lesbian Mothers groups were quite popularwith the watchers. The parents OF gays and lesbians group was alsowarmly received.Ducks on Trucks were an amusing counterpoint to some of the moreserious groups with their inflatable ducks and feather-covered truck.The Gay Men's Chorus were all dressed in cute rainbow sailor caps andhad a ""carry"" (like a float, but the pieces were carried by themarchers) of a ship. They stopped and gave a rousing rendition of ""WeSail the Ocean Blue"" from HMS Pinafore.Several of the South-of-Market bars had floats liberally decorated withscantily clad mouth-watering hunks. (down, boy!)The ALGA group (Association of Lesbian & Gay Asians) had the best drag;most men look terrible in drag but several of them were even beautiful.There were many men in various degrees of drag; the most spectacularwas in a costume that would have been at home in any show in Las Vegas.It had a peacock feather headdress that reached several feet in theair, and he was positively dripping with rhinestones. Another guy wasdressed as a witch doctor, complete with horns, feathers, loin-cloth,and an antlered wand. Even the Foxy Lady women's wear shop in theMission had a float (apparently THE place to go to buy outrageousclothes).The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence were quite festive in theirrainbow-colored habits. And the Ladies Against Women had a sizeablecontingent, with their wonderful slogans: ""I'd rather be ironing,""""Protect the rights of the unconceived: sperm are people too,"" ""Rosesnot raises,"" and ""Suffering not sufferage.""I became all choked up at a car bearing just a pillow with a tiara; itwas in memory of Fat Fairy by her friends in Oakland.The watchers were almost as much fun to watch as the parade. A pair ofmen near us made quite a splash with their rainbow-striped hair. Atone point a Chinese tourist came up and asked if this was the 4th ofJuly parade; she didn't seem to speak enough English to understand uswhen we tried to explain what was going on. One woman was watching theparade bare-chested from atop a bus stop shelter.As the parade ended, the crowd poured into the street to follow it tothe rally in Civic Center. The speakers claimed that there were 300,000people there. Even given their usual penchant for exagerating, it wasquite exhilirating knowing that you were surrounded by hundreds ofthousands of gay people and their friends. There was the inevitablegroup of bible-thumpers alongside the parade route with their signsforetelling doom to us all but, other than that, nothing but goodwillfrom everyone.(It was interesting conjecturing about the average straight SanFranciscan's response to the parade; probably something about thosedamn faggots blocking off traffic all day. But I digress.)After going home to rest up for a while, we went to the party at theGalleria to dance. Either people are getting tired of these events orwe picked the wrong party: there were only about 300-400 people there,I'd guess. The Weather Girls performed but the music was, on thewhole, not so great.

You remember them, the lobby group that is credited with much of what happened last election. At least according to 60 minutes and Norman Lear and other hysterical liberal types. The people really didn't vote against the liberals, they just didn't understand what they were doing - after all how COULD anyone in their right mind vote against the liberal agenda - and that was because 'radical right wing groups' like Christian Voice fogged the issues. Of course it's about AIDS. As you read the quotes below please keep in mind what I said about Jerry. These folks are not adverse to puttin' you away!! ""A San Francisco newspaper - Thursday, October 18, 1984 - report said that 53% of homosexuals are carriers of the virus that causes AIDS -- according to the homosexuals' own figures that means there are over 10 million AIDS carriers!"" ""We can't sit back and hope and pray for some public action to be taken. We have got to be safe in hospitals, restaurants, and public places. Researchers beleive AIDS can even be spread by saliva and perhaps just by constant exposure."" ""Our children deserve a school free from this dreaded communicable disease."" ""We are not trying to hurt homosexuals or lock them away from the rest of the public . . . but we are serious about protecting ourselves from the ravages of diseases started and passed on by homosexuals."" ""This is not un-Christian but responsible. And we intend fro our government to take this responsibility to the public."" ""But first we must rally massive public pressure. Our government has acknowledged the threat of this plague by spending $100,000,000 on research for a cure -- coming up with little or nothing. Why then won't the government spend 10 cents to tell us how to protect ourselves. IF WE CAN'T ISOLATE THE DISEASE, WE MUST ISOLATE THE DISEASE SPREADERS. (italics theirs)"" ************** Now you can see the not quite accurate statements made above. You know, the way anti-Christian speakers (some homosexuals included, right?) address the beliefs and actions of Christians. The point I'm making is that people ARE starting to take action and get upset and is that the smell of panic in the air?? Remember this little letter I received goes to MILLIONS of American homes!!!! These people have a network like you wouldn't believe! And in light of the way the dems are dumpin' the homosexuals and other 'non-traditional' groups and movin' to the right (even ole Tubby Teddy for cryin' out loud!) it doesn't look like a fun time ahead. A few more years of exponential growth of AIDS and hey presto, ""SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING BEFORE MY KIDS GET SICK!!!"" I'd like to hear some ideas from you guys besides, ""I'm not spreadin' AIDS."", etc. I'm not at all sure WHAT you can do. But ONE thing you can do is exercise some common sense in attending those wonderful 'GAY Pride' marches - dump the geeks that are such an affront to the public taste and those who actually ATTACK the moral values of the majority (Sister Boom Boom, etc.). I mean, it doesn't take much thought to see making fun of someone's cherished beliefs makes for bad feelings. And I think you guys and gals will need all the friends you can muster over the next few years. My point about Jerry! Don't be fooled by the circle of friends and workers, etc who are all 'feel good' and 'modern' about homosexuality. I can see them turning on you if the rubber meets the road. Yuppies are NOT the wave of the future! One of these days the banks will call in their debt and they'll be Yuppies no longer. (They, as a group, have one of the highest debt rates.) People are going to stop patronizing restaurants with 'gay' waiters, etc. Will there be posters in Rest Rooms diagraming how to exit the stalls using only your elbows?? Yea, yea the kids poll in favor of leaving the homosexuals alone. But will it be the same when they grow up?? Where are the radicals of the '60's now? Isn't Jerry Rubin working on Wall Street? Is there really a change in the weather vis a vis morals? Are people getting fed up with the 'anything goes' stuff? Religion is MORE popular with he folks today than it was in the decades past! It's GROWING!!! And it's no secret what organized religion thinks about homosexuality. And don't believe that merde about politics and religion don't mix. We ALL know better!

Reprinted without permission.] Study: AIDS Robs Cells Of ""Recognition"" Ability by Richard Saltus =============================================== [Following close on the heels of another major discovery* :] The first step in the destruction of the immune system by the AIDS virus is a preemptive attack on the ability of key immune cells to recognize foreign organisms, a study shows. The virus acts with such precision that the immune system is utterly unable to mount a response, even though the capacity to counterattack still exists, government researchers said. Thereafter, normal immune competence collapses and the victim is left prey to a wide range of infections and tumors that cause the syndrome's high mortality. The report in today's New England Journal of Medicine adds to the growing evidence on how the AIDS virus - known as HTLV-III or LAV [or ARV] - destroys the very defenses designed to disable it. The virus' name, Human T-Lymphotropic Virus, signifies that it attacks T cells, the white blood cells that orchestrate the complex response of the immune system. The T cells recruit other cells into the fight, cause the release of certain antiinfection substances and stimulate B cells to produce antibodies. AIDS victims have a drastically reduced force of ""helper"" T cells, called T4, compared to the number of ""suppressor"" or T8 cells. What has not been clear is whether the low number of T4 cells or some inherent defect in the T4 cells is responsible for the progressive failure of the immune system. Resistance Tested Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases studied blood from 12 AIDS patients, challenging the immune cells with substances that should cause the T4 cells to proliferate rapidly. In this test the T4 cells were not required to recognize a foreign substance. The cells responded normally, showing that they retained the capacity to mount resistance to infection. Then the scientists mixed the blood with a foreign antigen, a protein of the sort that the immune system would encounter should the body be infected by an invading organism. This time there was no response. To the researchers this suggested that the T4 cells, which are equipped to distinguish what is foreign from what is ""self,"" had lost that ability. Dr. H. Clifford Lane, who directed the research, said that the infecting AIDS virus has been shown to attach itself to the T4 receptor, a molecule on the surface of the T4 cell. In effect, the virus blinds the cell to foreign antigens. Lane said it was impossible to be certain whether the virus uniformly knocks out the surface molecule on otherwise intact T4 cells, or perhaps kills off a subpopulation of T4 cells that has the recognition site. In any case, ""It's a very smart virus that came up with that way of attacking the immune system,"" sad Lane. He noted that these events occur early in the disease, leading to a cascade of later abnormalities as the immune system is devastated. No New Therapies Implied Lane, in a telephone interview, said that the discovery does not yet suggest any new therapies for the syndrome, but that it ""gives us a better appreciation of how the AIDS virus is attacking and destroying the immune system."" In an accompanying editorial, two Harvard scientists said that increasing knowledge about the affinity of HTLV-III/LAV for the T4 cells is helping to explain many of the puzzling aspects of the lethal syndrome - and is raising some concerns. For one thing, said Drs. Richard S. Kalish and Stuart F. Schlossman, when T4 cells multiply to fend off some other infection, they probably become more vulnerable targets to infection by the AIDS virus. This may explain, they said, why exposure to the AIDS virus is less likely to produce the syndrome in the absence of another infection, as in people receiving tainted transfusions and health workers exposed to HTLV-III. However, the Harvard researchers also raised the possibility that, in certain cases, the virus can infect not only T cells but also B cells. ""Such virally infected cells may function as a reservoir of virus, potentially thwarting attempts at reconstitution of the immune system,"" they wrote. While there is still no effective treatment for AIDS, Schlossman said in an interview, ""We've learned a great deal about the disease, and the future is not so bleak as one might think."" ***************************************************** * In late June the discovery of a gene on HTLV-III which regulates the rate of growth of the virus was announced. HTLV-III displays explosive growth at a rate up to 1,000 times as great as, eg, HTLV-I which is known to cause various cancers. Manipulation of this gene suggests not only possibilities for eventual vaccine production but even for the treatment of people already infected with the virus. So, folks, it probably pays to keep up your general health, to avoid other infections so as to deny the AIDS virus possible footholds in your bodies.

Some of you who read this newsgroup may have just recently come out and not remember the good/bad old days. I have enjoyed the war stories that older gay men have shared with me of their experiences in the ""Pre-Stonewall"" era; of having to hide, being involved in bar raids by the vice squad, not having any role models etc. They also felt that things were better in some ways; because they shared a common oppression, the men they knew felt a tighter commradeship than I see today. When I first came out there were no gay newspapers in the Boston area and I wasn't aware of the existance of ""Bob Damron's Guide"" On campus we got free copies of ""Boston After Dark"" which later became the ""Phoenix"" Very hesitantly I answered a personal ad from a man who also attended the same college as I. Larry introduced me to gay life; he was also the first man I slept with. Larry took me to my first gay bar ""the Other Side"" in Boston which closed years ago. It was a sleazy place where there was often trouble with fag bashers and the police. I have to admit to being quite excited on entering the bar, I was finally home; among others like me. All the people Larry introduced me to ralleyed around me like old friends; I was a new member in the fraternity and treated with love and respect. Very quickly Boston became my home away from home as I learned where all the other gay men hung out; Beacon Hill, the Back Bay, The Combat Zone, to name a few. This was long before the South End enjoyed the gen- trification that gay pioneers started. There was the Charles Street Meet- inghouse, a gay coffee house which was Boston's alternative to the bars. The bars were much more fun then, friendlier, full of life. Styx, the 1270 and Cabaret After Dark became my playground. The one thing that I recall was the lack of ""Attidude"" that prevails in the bars today. We had to stick together in an atmosphere of opression. The first gay pride parade I attended was festive, there wasn't the spectre of AIDS to deal with. It was a day to be seen and celebrate our unity; we still do cel- ebrate our strength but the parades seem somewhat angrier in recent years. There were other firsts I got to see; the first gay magazine that you didn't have to buy in the Combat Zone, a black and white slick magazine called ""Mandate"". It could be purchased in a few mainstream Boston book shops and corner stores. In a lot of ways I liked the first Mandate much more than what's out now. It had class, attractive models and lacked the explicitness that Mandate and it's followers show in their centerfolds today. Back in my early years of coming out the worst worry I had was of may- be getting rolled by a fag basher while leaving a bar. We would come and go as a group; safety in numbers! Like a lot of other men back then, I had never heard of ""Safe Sex"" and induldged freely whenever I could. I was a real slut in my 20's and proud of it. Back then a shot of penicillin could cure what ailed a guy. We're now faced with a lethal disease that has taken away friends, family and lovers. Why didn't AIDS start claiming lives 20- 30-40 years ago? Was it a product of our liberation? I can't answer that but it has certainly effected the way that we interact. There's another negative product I see which is an underlying attitude of ""I don't need you"" As we've become more tolerated/accepted by mainstream society there seems to be more of an aloofness toward each other; mostly in bars and gay neighborhoods. Guys went out of their way to introduce them- selves and be friendly way back then; at least to me. I was no beauty prize winner then so it wasn't because I was some hot little chicken; matter of fact friends see old pictures of me and say that I'm much more attractive now. So what's the bottom line to all my ramblings? I just feel that it was more fun to be gay in the late 60's and early 70's. Have we in some ways become a little jaded over time after fighting a long hard battle to gain acceptance? I still try to approach new gay social situations with all the enthusiasm I showed back in ""71"" but get met with apathy, attitude, etc. So how much headway have we made; AIDS is here for a while, a conservative political environment is taking some of our rights away; the child custoday case that's in the news comes to mind, etc. So! we are still operating in a stiffling world, we still need each other as much as in the Stonewall era. Go out and shake a new hand, give someone new a big hug!

However, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that this terrible disease must be stopped, at all costs, and as soon as possible, before it takes any more lives before their time. My ""uncle"" (which is what I called him) died at the age of 49, and by the time he did, he had the body and appearance of a man of 80. A friend of my uncle's, after the funeral, mentioned that Ronald Reagan asserted to a reporter that he would not help to subsidize AIDS research because in his words, that he could not condone a ""degenerate lifestyle."" Can anyone out there tell me if this is true? If so, I want him to look at my uncle's freshly dug grave, then look at me in my face and tell me that he deserved death because he was gay!

Comment,FT140CM01,,FT140,CM01,,1985,1985-07-23,21:47:33,Craig Werner,"Werner, Craig",!philabs!aecom!werner,1,A0079,,,A0079,The Immune System and Cancer: A Rebuttal,Net.med,"Subject: The Immune System and Cancer. In response to an article I pointed out that described the (albeitly limited) successes of Chemotherapy for Cancer, Thomas Stanions pointed out that this was only treating the symptoms and that the underlying CAUSE of cancer was a weak immune system. At the time, I did not respond. I could have said 'Well, it just ain't so.' However, that would have left me open to the retort, ""Well do you have proof?"" Good Question. Can one disprove the assertion that the development of cancer is caused by a weak immune system? After several months of thought, I can say ""Yes, it can be done."" (I even sent a copy of this for his perusal prior to my posting it.) Point 1: In order for anything to be attacked by the immune system, it must be recognized as 'foreign.'[*] Despite, years of searching, only three tumors (out of thousands) have been found that display foreign characteristics (called antigens). One is Choriocarcinoma, a cancer of the placenta, and it is recognized as foreign because it contains genes from the father; another is Burkitt's Lymphoma, which only occurs in cells that have been previously infected by Epstein-Barr Virus. In both cases, the tumors (20 years ago almost totally fatal) can be cured more than 95% of the time by a short round of chemotherapy, which slows the tumor down enough for the immune system to take care of it (as it would reject a graft or fight an infection, respectively). The third case, Colon cancer, the antigen found there, although not found in normal gut, is actually an embryonic antigen (i.e., it was there before birth and dissapeared) so is not recognized as foreign, and hence not attacked. The other two cancers, incidentally, almost never occur in the USA. * [It would take too long for me to adequately describe what 'foreign' entails. A definition for those who understand protein structure would be 'anything which presents a unique three-dimensional structure not normally encountered within the body' would capture the essence of 'foreigness.'] Objection 1: True, but could it be that the reason that no cancer has been found that the immune system can attack is because all the ones that the immune system could attack were killed early, and hence were never detected. This is unfortunately true (but for the researcher, intriguing), and illustrates the fact that the absence of positive proof does not constitute negative proof. [Perhaps someone should tell that to the Creationists, oh, well, nevermind.] Well, can the thesis that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer be disproven directly? Yes, it can. Point 2: The definitive experiment would be to weaken people's immune system and see if they developed cancer a few years down the line. Obviously, this cannot be done. It is not only impractical, but extremely unethical, and I doubt if one could get any volunteers for it anyway. However, there are two groups of people for whom this has already been one, one by nature, and another by medicine. I am referring to the 11,000+ people who have contracted AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), and to those who have received Kidney (or other organ) and have to be artificially immunosuppressed to keep from rejected the organ. The question then to ask is ""Do these people die of Cancer more often than the population at large?"" In the case of the AIDS population, the answer is that there are two relatively rare cancers that appear very frequently, one is Kaposi's Sarcoma, the other is another form of lymphoma. (But these are rare cancers - to give an idea, North Central Bronx Hospital has 5 cases of Kaposi's in the 25 years prior to 1980. They now get that many, all in AIDS patients, in a month.) Both of these only occur in certain, not all AIDS risk groups, so it could be that they are not a result of a weak immune system per se, but may be virally transmitted, like Burkitt's Lymphoma. As far as the Transplant patients go, I do not know of any increased risk of cancer among people receiving organ transplants. (It may actually be lower, only because they are more apt to die of complications relating to the earlier organ failure that required the transplant in the first place.) So there you have it, indirect but as near as can be definitive disproof of the theory that a weak immune system is responsible for cancer, or I should say, most cancer. [Further note: the working definition of a cured cancer is ""Disease free survival for a period of five years following cessation of therapy, or if death occurs by a non-related cause (an accident, say), absence of tumor at post-mortem exam."" Despite the non-feeling tone of the definition, it is the only OBJECTIVE way of evaluating survival.] -- Craig Werner !philabs!aecom!werner ""The world is just a straight man for you sometimes""",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/B8inQ-A80VE/m/p8a39gD17D8J,,,

I had pipe dreams of becomming a Madison Avenue Advertising executive, manipulating the minds of the consumer with slick persuasion, and making big bucks. My advisor gave me some books to read which soured my zeal toward this field. I opted instead, for a major in Operations Management. It was toward the end of my Sophomore year that my Marketing Professor offered alternatives to the class for a final term paper. One was to write a 20-25 page paper on ""Neglected Markets"" and their impact on the economy if they were pursued. Since I was now a semi-seasoned homophile; slept with more than my share of men, gone to P'Town and even marched in my first parade, I chose the ""Gay"" market to report on. My paper was chock full of statistics about gay people; discretionary income, populations, where they vacation, etc , a wonderful work of pure bullshit. The fateful day came when the term papers were returned and mine wasn't given back to me. When class ended the professor asked to see me alone in his office. I was shaking in my boots as he handed the masterpiece back to me with an ""A+"" in red on the cover sheet. He told me that gays were hardly one of the markets he had in mind but the content showed a lot of hard work. His next line floored me, ""Mr Levasseur you earned the A+. Your paper shows a lot of insight into this subculture....I would almost believe that you're one of them. You must have had some inside source to aid in your research"". As I left, he made a parting comment, ""I don't really think that your example for a prime time Television ad would fly on the major netowrks"" The scenario: Two men are standing on the front porch of a suburban house at the front door. It's quite late at night and they're smiling at each other. They join hands and kiss. <Voiceover> ""If he kissed you once, will he kiss you again.....be cetain with Certs"" The question I raised with this example was how this ad would impact sales? Would more gay people buy the product since they could identify with it? Would the rest of the population continue buying this product. Looking back, it was a pretty outrageous advertising proposal for 1972. This bring me to our buying power in the economy. A lot of gay men and women I know are upwardly mobile. They tend to have larger than average disposal incomes and can scoff up new products as they're introduced. They also tend to have good taste in decorating, clothes, dining out, etc. Gays also tend to be pioneers in fashion, urban renewal and other areas. Everyone seems to follow our lead without being aware of the source. Since coming out I've seen more than a few styles and trends become commonplace that were once thought of to be gay only. Some that come to mind are; High Heel Shoes --------------- I remember in the early 70's when first coming out that a lot of gay men were wearing shoes with elevated heels. Boy! those suckers were uncomfortable but I had a few pairs myself. Everywhere I went in suburbia there would be whispered remarks of ""faggot"" from townies. Within a year, a lot of the straight guys were wearing the same thing.....monkey see monkey do. I went back to wearing my Adidas's Silky Nylon Shirts ------------------ They usually clung to the body and looked pretty sharp. Again, I got a lot of snide remarks from straights. Given time, they all started weaing the very shirts I was put down for wearing. Jewelry ------- When I came out, the man I was dating wore a thin gold serpentine chain. I bought one also and caught flack from the straight kids on campus as well as my folks, ""Why do you wear a chain like Robert's? Do you want everyone to think that you're a fairy?"" Shortly afterward, I got my ear peirced. Boy! did this ever bring the house down in Lowell, Mass back in 1972. The only other group at the time who wore earrings in Lowell were the Hell's Angels, and no-one would dare call them faggots. In recent years I see more and more straight kids wearing gold chains and earrings. Disco's ------- Around the time I came out the only music that the straight kids were dancing to was rock. Egad! I can't believe that I danced to Led Zeppelin. Robert in- troduced me to Black dance music. I hated it at first but it was sink or swim at the gay clubs. My record collection started showing a larger and larger percentage of Barry White, Three Degrees and Supremes lp's. This was before ""Disco"" became a household word. I was also hearing a lot of music that didn't get air play. It seemed that the only people who bought these records were Blacks, Hispanics and gays. I quit going to frat parties because their music was now boring. You guessed it! disco caught on with the local straights, disco music now was played on a couple of FM stations. Word got out that the music was hot at our clubs. Straights dropped in at the 1270 in Boston to dance on our turf. I've read articles in Billboard and other trade magazines about how gays really were the impetus behind the disco movement. We also gave perform- ers like Donna Summer the push to stardom; even Bette Midler got her start at the Continental Baths in New York. Working Out ----------- I may be all wet here but feel that gay men had a lot to do wth the popularity of Nautilus centers and other forms of fitness. Gay men; especially urban ones, tend to be in much better physical shape then their straight peers. A lot look much younger then their years due to taking care of their bodies. A lot of this ties in with the fear of aging in our society. In the gay world this gets exag- gerated a bit; fear of the spare tire around the waste and other boogeymen of growing older. Most of the women at work are amazed at how old I am; a lot of other gay men probably hear the same thing. People want to look good; if we can do it, so can they. Levis and Military Garb ----------------------- Ahhhh! Levi 501'S, a necessary part of the urban clone's wardrobe. I can remem- ber when 501's were an oddity in Boston; primarily worn by gays. They fit well and showed a man's best ass*ets. Now they're advertised on tv, MTV, etc. The rest of the country started following suit. The same goes for military fatigue pants, khaki tank tops, military boots, etc. A lot of urban gay clones look very hot dressed in this kind of drag; macho, butch! Straight guys love things that drip with testoscerone. They see us and think ""wow! how macho"" Even the hijickers on TWA 847 thought that the two gay men looked macho. Good thing that the hijackers couldn't see any further than the ends of their noses. So yes, we know how to wear our clothes well. Clothes make the man, and we seem to set the pace for casual fashion. Bottom line to working out, jewelry and mode of dress is, it's hard to pick the gay men from the straights today; they look more and more like us. Quiche ------ This poor lowly scrambled egg pie suffered obscurity until gay men thought it chic to serve it at brunch and dinner parties. Now we're becomming a country of quiche eaters. The same goes for Perrier and related bottled spring waters. I never knew what Perrier was until my first trip to Provincetown. While on the subject of food, gay restaurants tend to be trendy meeting places for gays and straights alike. Three of my favorite outer suburban restaurants are quite obviously gay owned but attract a rather large straight following. They all have much bette than average decors, interesting menus and good food. Urban Renewal ------------- When I first came out Boston's South End was the kind of place I wouldn't have let my cat walk around in. Gay men started moving in and cleaning things up. Over the years the South End has become one of Boston's largest gay neighbor- hoods and prime property to upwardly mobile heterosexuals as well. We started it and they have jumped on the bandwagon. We make it liveable and they sooner or later start moving in. Now that Gentrification is well established, a lot of gay men are moving into other areas of boston that the average heterosexual person may not find palatable; Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, Chelsea, etc. It will be interesting to see what kind of impact we make in these surrounding towns. There are many other areas where we have started fads and trends. I started this article by talking about my college days in marketing class. IN some ways the gay movement has been a covert advertising force, changing the way that straights dress, dine, and party. It's just my own observation, but gays seem to have an enhanced feel for esthetics; not just sight, but all five of the basic human senses. Maybe it comes from our sensitivity, I really don't know! Almost every gay person's home I've been in is more visually pleasing and comfortable than the majority of straight homes I've visited. I don't know, but we're doing something right. What will be the next trend? I'll just grab my coon skin cap, hitch up the horses and take my covered wagon to the next frontier.",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/Cl67AIrIz20/m/2IVtUZUZ5-wJ,,,

Disclaimer: the following is not medical advice, I am not trained in medicine or health care. The following is merely my observation and opinion. I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported in the responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native). My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it gets DIRECTLY into your bloodstream. The evidence: 1. The virus has been found in the following bodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others. 2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS because during anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcuts into the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semen deposited there can get directly into the blood stream. 3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS because remnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another. 4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercourse because the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues. 5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) because the ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly into the blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound in her/his mouth. 6.

Was it published? References, please? BTW, what is the relation between the International Academy of Preventive Medicine and main-stream M.D.-type medicine? (A question for both Mr. (Dr?)

[The ellipsis covers a few sentences.] The idea, that AIDS requires a breakdown of the immune system after prolonged stress, reminds me of the work of Hans Selye. I had the impression he was respected by main-stream medicine. If this is the case, is it consistent with supposing that main-stream medicine pooh-poohed the Holists' view of AIDS? >A West German study, done in 1976, showed that the average person, in >western industrialized society, was exposed to >1000 times as many >stresses/person/day as people were 100 years ago, and that the rate >was increasing faster every year. 90% 0f those stresses were not >psychological, or social, but, were physical, chemical, nutritional, >electromagnetic smog, etc.; ENVIRONMENTAL stresses that didn't even >exist 100 years ago. References, please? AND critical treatment of these issues: (a) What is your universal quantitative measurement of the severity of a ""stress"", and how is this measurement justified? (b) How did the West Germans measure the stresses that people were subjected to 100 years ago, and how were these stresses quantitatively compared to those of today? Consider the environmental stresses that people faced 100 years ago, in comparison with those of today. Driving is stressful; but being limited to the speed of a horse and buggy ( ~ 4 miles per hour) must have been frustrating and therefore stressful as well. Which is better? Well, which have you chosen for yourself? Then there were the nutritional stresses... no fresh green veggies in winter, no refrigeration in summer, food preserved by smoking or salting it... (too much salt in the diet, not to mention carcinogens galore)... Somewhere I read once that in the early 1800's, English bakers frequently put alum in their bread to whiten it. (Cross reference discussion of aluminum and Alzheimer's Disease.) A consequence was kidney/bladder stones; Eton's infirmary had a ward for boys with bladder stones. This is getting far afield of AIDS; but it makes me feel uncertain that, where holistic medicine is valid, it is all that far from main-line M.D. medicine. Regards, Chris -- Full-Name: Christopher J.

The next best thing is to avoid exchanging bodily fluids with strangers. Any ""vigorously healthy"" or even ""average"" person would have to be out of his mind to think that his presumably healthy immune system is immune to getting AIDS: there are too many ""vigorously healthy"" people who are now seriously ill or dead.

A couple of points of clarification:chickenpox and shingles are both caused by herpes zoster, and not by theherpes simplex viruses. Also, there are no human cancers which are yetproven to be caused by a virus, with the possible exception of AIDS-relatedKaposi's sarcoma, but the mechanism of the development of KS in people withAIDS is still unelucidated. The ""noises"" about viral contributions toother diseases such as MS and juvenile diabetes are actually early leaks ofscientific investigation in progress, so it is simply silly to claim thatthe ""medical profession doesn't care.""He also betrays a rather peculiar attitude towards those who practicemedicine, as if they were selling something ""guaranteed"", rather than theunfortunate truth even in this day and age, namely, that they are peoplewho try to use their limited knowledge to help people get well, or barringthat, remain as comfortable as possible. Research is always trying toexpand the horizon of what is known so that it can be safely andeffectively applied in medical care, but there will always be gaps in ourknowledge. ""Acute embarassment?"" Hardly--there is no reason whatsoever tobe embarassed. Frustrated and challenged, maybe.As he says, viruses are a particularly difficult nut to crack, becausetheir actions are intimately tied up with the ordinary expression ofgenetic information in the cell; they don't really ""live"" on their own, soit is much harder to discover and produce the kinds of ""magic bullets""which have been the hallmark of modern therapy for other infectiousdiseases. Also, the herpes viruses seem to hide very well from the body'simmune system by residing in the spinal ganglia inbetween flareups. Butthere have been a number of effective drugs introduced in the last 15 yearswhich have anti-viral activity in very specific situations: idoxuridine incorneal herpes simplex, vidarabine in corneal herpes and herpes simplexencephalitis, and most recently, acyclovir for these indications and thesymptomatic treatment of genital herpes as well. Amantadine is effectivein the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A infection, and we can expectmore progress on these fronts as research continues.

This is indeed the major problemwith fighting viral infections. Antibiotics work *because* bacteria have asufficiently complicated metabolism. You can feed a person erythromycin(which screws up bacterial protein synthesis) without killing the patientbecause a person's protein making machinery is sufficiently different fromthe bacteria's that it is not affected by the drug.Viruses don't have any metabolism of their own; they are parasiteswhich rely on the host's metabolic machinery to grow. Since they share ourmetabolism, it is difficult to find a way to interfere with their growthwithout also killing the patient.

Topicalantibiotics work for some, not for all.Also a good one is Accutane (Isotrenoine or cis-retinoic acid),which is a kinked analogue of Vitamin A. Given for a short time, it worksin a large percentage of cases, and its effects are permanent -- i.e. justlike a cure.During the administration, the side effects are just slightly worsethan taking high doses of Vitamin A alone (but Vitamin A is toxic in highdoses -- not as high as are given here though by a safe margin)The side effects are dry skin, cracked lips, nose bleeds -- thisstuff really dries you out. Also are blurred vision and headaches. Oh, for thefirst few weeks, the acne gets worse. There is also something concerningserum cholesterol, which has to be monitored.Also for women: it is very important that you not be pregnant sinceAccutane causes birth defects (just as Vitamin A overdoses do) in earlyfetuses. Thus, most dermatologists will not start women on this drug untilafter menses, to insure they are not pregnant, and advise them in nouncertain terms not to get pregnant while on the drug.From personal experience, I was on it several years ago for 3 months.(just when it became available for secondary trials.)I had every side effect, even ones I didn't find out about until later. Someof these went away with a slightly lowered dose. About two months after Iwent off it, my acne was gone (and the acne on my back was so bad it kept mefrom sleeping sometimes beforehand).

The following is merely my observationand opinion.I have been following very carefully the medical news as reported inthe responsible gay press (mainly the New York Native).My hypothesis: you can only catch the AIDS virus if it getsDIRECTLY into your bloodstream.The evidence:1. The virus has been found in the followingbodily fluids: blood, semen, saliva, and perhaps others.2. Anal intercourse is highly correlated with AIDS becauseduring anal intercourse, the anal passage lining incurs microcutsinto the blood-vessel rich tissue and the AIDS virus in the semendeposited there can get directly into the blood stream.3. Sharing of needles is highly correlated with AIDS becauseremnants of the blood of one person is being injected into another.4. Penile-vaginal intercourse is less correlated with ADIS than anal intercoursebecause the vaginal tissues are less fragile than the anal passage tissues.5. Deep kissing seems to be relatively unrisky (but not completely so) becausethe ""tainted"" saliva of one of the kissers will not get directly intothe blood stream of the other unless the latter has a cut or wound inher/his mouth.6. There is no evidence that the disease can be caught from airborne viruses.--+--------------+-------------------------------+| Rob Bernardo | Pacific Bell |+--------------+ 2600 Camino Ramon, Room 4E700 || 415-823-2417 | San Ramon, California 94583 |+--------------+-------------------------------+---------+| ihnp4!ptsfa!rob || {nsc,ucbvax,decwrl,amd,fortune,zehntel}!dual!ptsfa!rob |+--------------------------------------------------------+",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/mOyXcZB48N8/m/7_vvU_AXwTkJ,,,

I don't count Ken Arndt because he doesn't contributehe har*ass*es, and annoys but he doesn't contribute. For the most partI enjoy the ""jason"" material but its not really substantive. Occasionally Isee factual reportage of parades, or film fests, or Aids research, butI dont find dialog or anything resembling real discussion of the issuesthat face Gay people living in America today. Obviously the vast majorityof subscribers to this news group are just readers, I guess this is standardbut it would seem to me that we are missing an opportunity here to takeadvantage of a valuable resource.

Often I need to check some newsgroup that is guaranteeddaily postings (like net.jokes or net.bizarre) to determine if my notesfeed has dried up or what. Look in net.women or net.religion and you willfind a whole different kind of ballgame, but here in net.motss you hardlyever see responses to the few articles that do offer informative materialworthy of discussion.

We could refer to this special brandof attitude as *net*itude. And who says you gotta be gay to post to motssIs Ken Arndt the only non gay who reads this newsgroup? I suspect that thereare plenty of people reading this newsgroup who are undecided about theirsexuality or who would be enriched by open disscusson of what it is to beGay in America today.Also from the geographical standpoint one might surmise that Gay peopleonly exist in Boston, and california. ( who knows mayby its true) ThoughI suspect that once again this apparently uneven distribution reflectscloseted attitudes.I think that it would be valuable for ROM's (Read Only MOTSS) to be ableto have access to a newsgroup with informative discussion on the many aspectsof what it means to be Gay and out of the Closet. It would also be valuablefor non gay readers to hear directly from us about the issues that face us.I Don't agree with Ken Arndt on practicly anything he says , and I definitlydon't agree with his method or style. But I think that Ken Arndt shows usan accurate portrayal of the kind of bigotry and missinformed public thatwe are gonna have to learn to deal with if we are to live our lives openlyand out of the closet. The slurs and stereotypes that Ken throws around arenot the product of his stagnant imagination, they are deeply ingrained inour cultural experience. Those of us who are priveleged to live in areaswith a well developed Gay press know that we are involved in a struggle forour lives that will only get more difficult before it gets better. We don'tneed Ken Arndt to tell us that large segments of American Society would likeus all to crawl back into our closets and die from our ""so called perverted""sexual practises. And it doesn't take a brilliant mind to deduce that beforethe AIDS crises is over there are gonna be a whole lot of Ken Clones blamingGay people for inflicting AIDS on the nongay population. Unfortunatly theamerican public does not get the in depth coverage of the latest AIDS researchnor does it get accurate reporting about the fact that AIDS is epidemic amongstsome hetero populations in Africa.This network is a new Media, perhaps the only media where the individual hasthe opportunity to adress everyone else and still maintain a low profile.Even if you are so closeted that you feel you cannot reveal yourself at yourworkplace you can ask someone who posts regularly to forward your anonymousopinion.(no guarantees I guess but it might be your first opening to becominga complete human being) If you have root access its no problem to create ananonymous acct to post with. Computer networks are marvelously anonymouscreatures in themselves in that you can reach deep levels of communicationwithout having to risk close personal contact. I used several BBS systemshere in the Bay area when I was first coming out and it provided me withmany hours of theraputic contact with others without ever once having to revealmy self to any one on a personal level. After getting used to myself as a Gayidentified person on the BBS's for six months it was a relativly easy transitionto integrate myself back into the world of the living.To get back to my main point....there are a lot of things we could be discussinghere that could provide valuable resources for us all, Gay and non Gay alike.I know that this letter is pretty long as it is but I would like to introducea topic that is important to me. (just to get it going OK)I have taken care in this posting to avoid using the word straight...For one thing I'm not bent or broken (least i wasn't last time I looked)and since I'm writing I will use the terms I like which are Gay and non-Gay.Net.women has had a lively discussionabout pronouns and gender identificationand I think that the concept of labeling by sexual preference fits right into all the points being made over there on that subject. perhaps you mighthave some interesting insight about how words and labels... like Gay and Fagor Queer etc etc... create the reality of our situations.

My contact with the gaycommunity has been very little (mostly a couple of gay men I met in theNavy) and I was curious as to just how different gays are from straights.After reading 'Jason On Bars', I came to the conclusion that theinhabitants of gay bars belong to the same 'types' as those who go tostraight bars (if you want to classify people into types). The onlydifference is sexual orientation.One person I worked with in the Navy 'came out' to me shortlyafter I started working with him (this was in the early sixties). Imust have had a shocked look on my face because he immediately triedto reassure me, in a somewhat disgusted manner, that he wasn't goingto attack me in the showers or curl up in my bunk with me! He wasrather effeminate and took a lot of guff from those who didn't knowhim or work with him. We didn't discuss his gayness, so our discussionscentered mostly around work, home, future plans, etc. I'm somewhatsorry now we didn't talk about being gay, because I think I wouldn'thave been so homophobic for so long if we had.I have been 'hit on' a couple of times in bars by gays sincethen, but I just said it wasn't my style and they moved on. It did make mea little uneasy at the time, but it wasn't traumatizing.I've done a little analyzing of my homophobia, and have cometo the conclusion that it stems from insecurity about my own masculinity.If I am seen talking to a gay man or admit I have gay acquaintances orfriends, I THINK that others (males mostly) will think I am gay. Itreally shouldn't matter what others think as long as I know what andwho I am.After reading this group for so long, I think I can acceptgays better than I could a few years ago, but I'm still not entirelycomfortable about it. Gays are not going to go away and they're nota 'threat', so where's the problem? I don't know.To be perfectly honest here, I must say that I think beinggay is wrong; if not entirely from a religious standpoint, thencertainly from a biological one. However, I'm not going to try toconvince you folks of that - I'm going to try to accept you as youare.Just a few thoughts from a former homophobe....Pete WilsonAT&T IS CGBSMontgomery Works..!ihnp4!mgnetp!mgwess!plw",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/-UwNgTyojC8/m/4mTKM3Uid1MJ,,,

The reason forfeeling gratified is obvious. The sadness comes with the recurringreminder, we Holistic types keep getting, that the power and money arestill going to the people who don't know what is going on. While thepractitioners who have understood the solution to most of the medicalproblems we face today, for at least 10 years, are still beingattacked by their colleagues as ""quacks and charlatans"".Eventually, even the most obtuse ""medical experts of the day""understood the Pasteur was right. Even Pasteur, on his deathbed,said: ""If I had it to do over, I would have spent more time onindividual immunity than on the germ!""The strength of any theory depends on how much of the observedphenomena are explained by that theory. In my >25 years of practicingand teaching medicine I have seen no approach that explains theobserved, or gets the results, 1/4th as well as the holistic paradigm.Eventually the truth will out. This theory has been advanced severaltimes this century, by many prominent practitioners of medicine.However, because we still didn't have the technology, or sufficientlyadvanced knowledge and methods of communicating that knowledge, theapproaches tended to die with their practitioners.

You might be interested to know that we share some of the same views. I have also been unhappy about the volume of postings to this net group. What is there tends to be of good content, but what struck me the most is I always see the same names. I am posting this via anonymous electronic mail for two reasons. I am new to the net and have just not learned how to post, and as I am only working for the summer, it was not worth taking the time. Also, to be honest, I would hesitate to post to this news group because I would not want anybody getting the wrong idea about me, even if I am married. Of course if anybody did, that would mean they also read this news group, right? It will not be possible for me to receive any mail, as I am getting ready to leave, but I probably still be reading the news group, so any public responses (good or bad) are welcome. I am sure you wonder why I would be interested in your news group. Some of you may think it is only a sordid curiosity. I like to understand what is happening around me. The foreign friends I have had fascinate me when they talk about their culture and beliefs. In the same way your culture fascinates me. You live a life and emotions I do not understand, only because you are in a situation unlike any I have ever known. The only close gay friends I have had were in high school, and still in the transition period where they had serious questions within themselves, so yours is a world completely unfamiliar to me. As for Ken Arndt, I know he attacks a very sensitive area with you, but I really think it should not bother you. In reading other news groups, he is just as unpopular. More than any other, he is openly insulted for his view points. Coming from anybody else, I can understand the agony it would cause, but Ken is a sub-human life form with a pretense of human emotions. I was honestly surprised when he said he still loves you, and when are you going to get together. I would have been even more surprised if you had taken him up on it, and would have assumed it was only to greet him in hostile numbers with ulterior motives, but then that would be sinking to his level. One thing I would like to say, just as you might not like being characterized as having a certain behaviour because you are gay, I too feel slightly offended by the category you lump us in at times. Remember, the most hostile are probably also the most verbal. Do you always have the best of your group represent you? On our campus the ""leader of the gays"" (self- proclaimed, of course) was the local joke, and though I don't know this for a fact, I suspect he only made things harder for some of the others. It seemed that every time he did not get what he wanted it was because he was discriminated against for being gay. This was believable the first time, but the fourth or fifth time, the story got old. Now, if I believed he truly represented all gays on our campus, I would have come up with a pretty low opinion of them. Instead, I chose to judge people on an individual basis. On the Jason on Bars article - I found it amusing. It seemed to me to be a cross between honesty and friendly humour. It did not seem like the article of a depressed resentful person taking his problems out on others. I also learned something from it, as I have learned from all of the articles, but I didn't take it as a verbatim narrative of a typical night at the bars. It seemed the point was the emotions creating the actions, not a satire of the gay whores. The articles on the gay emotions have been much more interesting than the rehashed stories on AIDS. This is the only place I know that I can find such honesty about the feelings and struggles of gay people. Of course, it would mean more if more people contributed. I strongly encourage others to take advantage of the anonymous postings. It would also help if any body who did chose some nick name, so multiple postings can be easily followed. Well, I know I have rambled on. I hope this was taken in the positive way it was intended. If I have inadvertantly offended anybody, I apologize. I am not aware of everything that is acceptable, ie - I didn't know homosexual was a derogatory term until reading this group, I always thought the term gay was more insulting.

The issue of differences between gay and straight people is complicated and multi-faceted, depending on the points you want to make and the method of analysis you take. I'm going to concentrate on what will seem almost blatantly obvious and not worth mentioning to some, but subtlety often gets lost in this discussion, so I'll forge ahead. My thesis is, simply, that there is no such thing as a ""gay emotion"" and that there are few categorical emotional differences between straight or gay relationships. This is no less true for committed couples, either cohabiting or married, a form of relationship which is probably less affected by gay/straight ""cultural differences"" for the points I wish to make. Right now I know a *lot* of couples--my straight friends are all at that late 20's-early 30's ""marrying age"", and being in a long-term relationship myself, we've also gained a lot of gay couples as friends. I see the same joys, trials and committment regardless of their sexual orientation. You still have to take out the garbage, still have to build a compatible living arrangement, still can reflect on your partner sleeping next to you, still have to plan together the life you both wish to live. The emotions which bind a couple together and which grow over time are identical in straight or gay relationships. I am not trying to dismiss the differences between straight and gay relationships (which certainly are there: should make some interesting followup discussion--hint, hint). I *am* trying to emphasize the commonality which comes, simply, from our shared humanity. -- /Steve Dyer {harvard,seismo}!bbncc5!sdyer sd...@bbncc5.ARPA",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/mCAeOBg2_no/m/8hhj4rjlDZAJ,,,

This is it.After thinking, I came up with three major personal issues that haveto do with my being a gay man on a daily basis.- feeling disenfranchised- AIDS- forming a home with someoneI feel incredibly vulnerable about what I wrote below, but what thehell. I feel most vulnerable in front of those people at work thatwill read this but who I do not know well enough to talk about myfeelings with.DISENFRANCHISEMENTI feel disenfranchised as a result of heterosexism. (By'heterosexism' I mean an unwitting or unconscious assumption onsomeone's part that everyone is heterosexual and perhaps leads acertain type of life, e.g. marriage, family.)The disenfranchisement I feel does not come from individuals Ipersonally deal with, but more from people at a distance or frominstitutions. For example, the people at work who I talk with arebasically not heterosexist. But the words and actions of coworkerswho I do not interact with much, even professionally, sometimes makeme feel disenfranchised. Just subtle things in the way they phrasethings sometimes. Usually nothing so consciously anti-gay that, if Ichose, I could challenge them about.Nobody but me in our office openly gay that I know of. No one toREALLY talk 'sisterly' with. There are a couple three people at workI can sort-of talk with to in the way I would only normally do toanother gay man, e.g. feeling comfortable enough to remark how nice itis that there are quite a few construction workers around to look at(the building is half unbuilt). And that comfort came only veryrecently.Sometimes I feel lonely.AIDSI don't think there has been a single day in the past year or so thatI have not thought about, worried about the threat of AIDS. The NewYork Native (a NY-based gay biweekly newspaper that is national in itsscope of news) arrived today and a good quarter of its 60 odd pages isabout AIDS.I will go to the gym tomorrow morning. I will see perhaps a littlebruise there or a red mark here and the first thing that flashes in mymind is KS, even when I KNOW that I ALWAYS get a little bruise therefrom horseback riding, and that I ALWAYS have had that little red markhere ever since I can remember. I will effortlessly use the exercisecycle for 20 minutes, but later in the day when I return to my officefrom lunch and get a little winded going up three flights of stairswhile talking at the same time, I wonder if it is pneumocystis. OnFriday, Bay Area Reporter, a local gay newspaper, will come out. Iwill turn to the obituary column with morbid interest. There will behalf a dozen photos, mostly of gay men about my age, some of whom Iwill recognize from the neighborhood, from the gym, etc. Infrequentlythere will be someone I knew well, a person I once dated, or aroommate I once shared an apartment with.Do you think there's a chance Reagan will get AIDS from the blood (Ipresume) he got during his polyp surgery?Sometimes I feel terror.HOMEI dream of having a home life with another man on a gentleman's farm.Something small but pretty.

Have been usinga system in Sausalito CA and was excited to recently learn of newsnetand the net.motss section. Too bad the previous poster didnt suggestsome new topics after decrying what was here. I skipped the AIDSarticles. Living in San Francisco we are pretty well taken care ofon the AIDS front in terms of progress in discovering causes and cures.I was very interested in the articles on Massachusetts and child carehaving gone through the adoption process here in San Francisco as anopenly gay couple. In case readers didn't know, there have beengay and lesbian couples in San Francisco who have adopted children. Andthere is an active support group for those parents. But that doesn'tmean its easy street. The foster care section in San Francisco stilldrags their feet. For them it isn't so much a gay or lesbian issue asmuch as it is every social worker wants to hold on to the kids hopingthat next week there will be that ""ideal"" couple that will presentthemselves and the child can be placed with them. As well all know those""ideal"" couples exists only in glossy pages consequently the kids remainin foster homes while the social workers play out their games.An issue that hasn't been broached here so far and which Iam interestedin is the gay/lesbian religious scene. Iam particularly interested inthose who choose to remain in their particular denomination and work fromwithin for change as I opted not to do that and am active in an MCCcongregation. Contrary to what some people see, I see a resurgence inreligious activity and feeling across the whole spectrum of religiouslife. Admittedly I probably have a biased view. ANd what I find even ofmore interest is that altho the mainline denominations have done a goodjob of dumping on gays and lesbians, many of us retain our spirituality.Another topic I find of interest is the question of monogamy and itsapplicability to gay people. I rememeber a few years back reading in anewspaper an editorial stating that being gay meant being freed from allthose sexual hangups and stereotypes of our parents - that the idea ofmarriage was no longer relevant. Well I personally have been in amonogamous relationship for 20+ years and just like my parents celebratedthat relationship with a religious ceremony so the editorial didn't ringtrue to me. But since then I have read a couple of studies pre-AIDS andpost-AIDS that seem to indicate that the gay relationship is quitedifferent from the heterosexual one and that the question of sexualfidelity is also quite different. Perhaps that is due more to the sexesinvolved as I would suspect sexual fidelity for lesbians is close to theheterosexual model. I don't know. Would be interested in comments.Having been out for many many years to family, work, etc.I have strong feelings about the Rock Hudson affair - revolving around theopportunities he had to break the gay stereotype for middle America.Opportunities he missed.So in conclusion - Im very glad to have found all of you and hope tohave some interesting times here.

The minister and his lover had adopted a baby boy.The adoption had been private - the mother was a lesbian who knew theadoptive parents and it was all handled through attorneys. That startedmy spouse and I thinking about the possibility of having children. Bothof us come from large families - 6 children in my family and 10 in hisand we both have strong ""family"" feelings. About a year later theminister and other gays and lesbians who had children appeared on a localtv program and that convinced us that we would start the process and seewhat happened.So I went to the City Social Services Department and started the applicationprocess for adoption. In the written parts of the application it appearedas if I was a single man but during the interviews with the social workerit became apparent that they were looking for two parent adoptions. It wasmade abundantly clear that two parent applicants had better chances at asuccessful adoption than singles. At that point I told the social workerthat indeed it was a 2 parent application and in my viewpoint the unit hadexactly the strengths he was looking for. I also invited him to our HolyUnion (wedding) in a few weeks. The process also includes a series ofmeetings with other prospective adoptive parents covering the whole rangeof child raising issues. We joined a group consisting of 5 heterosexualcouples, two single women (neither a lesbian), and us. It was an interestingexperience for all concerned. Over the span of the meetings we found thesocial agency and the classmates to be extremely supportive and one meetingwas spent exploring the issue of gay adoptive parents.The cruel reality of life was however, that all those people were matchedwith children at the end of the classes and we were not. Another group wasformed and all those people were matched but we were not. At that pointour classmates organized a letter writing campaign and demanded a meetingwith the Director of Social Services. Concurrently with that another gaypeople had applied for adoption. One of the people was experienced withnursing and the other worked in a child care center. While they couldhesitate on our ""qualifications"" the other couple's were impeccable. Asluck would have it, that couple was matched with a child who has now beenofficially adopted by them.After that adoption the agency cooled on our application and no othergay couples were in the pipeline so to speak. The agency's adoption staffwent through a 100% turnover. Two years went by with us being on an emotionalrollercoast -- will they call this week? maybe next week?. We completedall the forms and were certified as foster parents also. We waited. Wehoped. After 2 1/2 years a social worker called to see if we were stillinterested because he had noticed our file and it was pretty old. (We hadgotten lost in the shuffle, he said. Homophobia, I thought). A week laterhe called to see if were interested in adopting a fetal-alcohol syndromechild. No firms offer - just wanted to know if there was interest. Myspouse and I talked it over and decided that we didn't believe the workerand it was time to climb down off the roller coaster. So we told himno. We never heard again.Summary - we didn't personally get a child but were able to be supportpeople for another gay couple as they went through the process. Ourinitial contact spurred the agency to have some internal training onsexual minorities and training, we helped at least 5 couples work throughsome gay bias. It still hurts not succeeding.

Iwas sad in part because AIDS is a terrifying, heartbreakingillness. I was sad that Rock felt he had to live his life theway he did. At first, I was angry that he hadn't come out yearsago. Then I realized that had he done so, he would not havebeen able to land another job. Rock was almost always cast as aromantic leading man. What kind of producer or director wouldcast an openly known homosexual in those kinds of roles? I'dunderstand it -- I'd probably go to see those movies BECAUSE ofthe casting -- but most of middle America, most advertisers,etc., simply could not accept it. If Rock had come out inHollywood, he would never have worked again. What kind of rolemodel would that provide? The message ""you come out and you'redoomed"" wouldn't exactly help public understanding. It wouldfuel the fires of the bigots in terms of work discriminationand blackmail arguments.Word has it that Rock's homosexuality was more or less generallyknown in Hollywood -- that it was just something people knew anddidn't talk about. I guess I can understand that ""you don'trock the boat and we'll keep you along for the ride"" attitude.I'm certain that he is not the only homosexual in show biz. I'malso certain that many people in the business have somethingpersonal that they'd just as soon not let the public know about.I remember a Baba Wawa interview with Harvey Fierstein (sp?) theTony-award-winning author-actor of ""Torch Song Trilogy"" and thewriter of the book for the musical ""La Cage aux Folles"". He isprobably the most well know (the only?), openly gay figure inthe theater today. Baba made some comment that 10 years ago,she could not have done an interview like that -- talking openlyto a gay man on prime time TV about his life and his work. Hesaid something along the lines of the following:Isn't it absurd all this attention I'm getting.You know and I know that I'm not the first gayactor on Broadway, I'm not the first gay writer,I'm not the first gay anything. Gay people havebeen involved in every aspect of the theatersince its inception, and some of the most well-known figures in the American theater have been gay.He was right of course. All of the secrecy is ridiculous, butthere is a problem of acceptance to be dealt with. There is asaying: ""You can tell the pioneers by the arrows in theirbacks."" I think that would have gone (may still go) for thefirst crop of people in the entertainment industry who dealopenly with their homosexuality. I don't think that America isready to handle it.While I think that the initial news about Hudson was not handledvery well. [The initial press releases that he was (1)recovering from the flu, then (2) had liver cancer.] I do thinkthat some good may come of this horrible happening. Now allAmerica knows someone with AIDS. Now the president knowssomeone with AIDS. [I have heard that Reagen has never spokenabout AIDS in public.] This could have a major effect on publicawareness and government assistance. It did make new coverstories in both Time and Newsweek, for example. I think it isvital that the public understand what AIDS does and does notrepresent. It represents an extremely serious health crisis forthis country. The final costs for treating and (hopefully)curing and preventing AIDS will be astronomical. AIDS WILLspread into the heterosexual community in greater numbers. ItWILL NOT be spread through casual contact, through theworkplace, etc. I hope that the Hudson disclosure helps tobring these issues home to the rest of America. What willhappen when the next five public figures are diagnosed and die?--Andy",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/1gPlSKpEJOI/m/5hzDUjrzrucJ,,,
Comment,FT163CM03,,FT163,CM03,,1985,1985-08-23,12:16:31,Dan Greening,"Greening, Dan",dgr...@ucla-cs.uucp,1,A0087,,,A0087,Here's something to discuss,Net.motss,"Laura Freeman raised some questions about when it's appropriate to come outpublically. While this will hardly answer the questions, I thought you mightfind it related. Since coming out in the press, and everywhere else (sometimesyou feel like you're on a high speed rollercoaster), I've observed severalpatterns.1. Don't come out all over the place until you've got some support. Parentsand the public can be awfully ugly. It certainly helps if you have closefriends to help you get through rough times. I owe my sanity to my ex, andto a few close friends.2. Don't be surprised, when you come out publically, that closeted gays avoidyou. They're closeted. Being seen with you can be a big threat to theircloset. But it's no loss. Closeted people are known for stabbing othergays in the back. You don't really want them around if you're a publicfigure.3. Do come out. Early and often. People (even straight gay-haters) have torespect you for your honesty. Believe it or not, I attribute my fairlypositive press (crossing my fingers) to being honest and forthright withreporters. They love it.4. Be proud of who you are. Tell people you are gay all the time. If youdon't, they assume you are straight. It's so much easier if you correcttheir misconceptions immediately. That way, when they find out later thatyou're gay, they won't feel lied to.5. Make the best press you can out of being gay. It seems wierd, butthe public is titillated by gay officials. Personally, gay politicsdoesn't figure into my UC student president job, but I use it for all it'sworth in the press.I literally had to TELL the UCLA Daily Bruin to mention my sexuality.I told them I was gay a million times, but until the Berkeley scooped themwith a story titled ""SBPC Elects Gay-Rights President,"" they said not apeep. Push it. Sometimes you have to.6. If you don't come out to your fellow workers, your family, and yourfriends, you are abandoning your brothers and sisters. We must all pavethe way for younger gays and lesbians. Unless we come out, they will haveto tough it out like we did: with too many uninformed and prejudiced jerksrunning around.Besides, you know how good it is for your mental health. No moresneaking around. No more contrived apologies for not taking a date to thecompany party. No more fake image. Just you and the truth. It's reallyquite a relief.If you fear losing your security clearance, get another job. Honestly,it's a short life. Why waste it unhappily afraid? Life is so much morefun when you're unhampered by puritan baggage.Now, here's the news:PRESS RELEASEGAY PRESIDENT TO REPRESENT 141,000 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTSAt an August 3rd Sacramento meeting, student officials from 9 University ofCalifornia campuses elected a gay activist as their statewide studentpresident. Dan Greening, a UCLA doctoral student in computer science, nowcoordinates the University of California Student Lobby, the 12th most powerfullobby in California. He represents 141,000 University of California studentsin Regents meetings, and in the California legislature. Greening also heads astatewide committee of 18 student representatives.In his new position, Greening will focus on student concerns like reducingstudent fees and improving affirmative action programs. ""Despite activerecruitment of minority undergraduate students, affirmative action currentlysuffers three major problems,"" Greening said, ""insufficient undergraduateretention, declining graduate enrollment, and a gross failure to tenureminority faculty."" Greening feels new innovative programs can improve minorityrepresentation.Greening also works with several other organizations. In June, Greeningwas elected co-chair of the United States Student Association lesbian/gaycaucus. He is helping the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles, a gayand lesbian PAC, to set up a computer database for direct mail campaigns.""MECLA gives a lot of clout to the Los Angeles gay and lesbian vote,"" heclaimed.As the University of California's first openly gay student president,Greening feels he provides a visible role model.

Frye,"Frye, Roger E.",,1,A0365,,,A0365,By the Bye-,Net.motss,"As a bisexual,I've been able to find lots of extra ways of hiding out.I was able to tell myself that I was adaptable or curious and adventuresome.When I had sex with men, I was just venting my excess sexual energy.(At least I could say that until I began looking at how intense male-malesex can be for me.)When I wrote articles and layed out issues for the Gay Community News,I was just hanging out with my friends and using the paper as a way to getpublished.(At least I could say that until they asked me to review a book aboutbisexuality, and I couldn't find a model voice inside me to write in.)When I lived and danced and marched and read books with lesbians(what's the label for the gay counterpart of a fag-hag?),well, I don't feel like dismissing that part too easily.There is the attraction to strong, independent women.There is the opportunity of being in the gay world without having to act.(I meant ""act"" as in action, but I'll leave in ""act"" as in a play.)By the bye again, has anyone noticed how many lesbians have begun sleepingwith men lately? Is this just a local anomaly? My data: Boston 4,Seattle 2.Back to the subject.I'm talking about using bisexuality as an extra way of hiding out in responseto P.HANSON:So, where are they all? Bisexuality is interesting because there arenow two closets to hide in i.e. one can be openly gay or straight andyet sneak on over to the other side. There is good reason for oneto do this. We now have admittedly gay politicians and public servantsbut could you imagine an admittedly bisexual one?I used to live in suburban Weston, MA. After my boyfriend spent some timewith me there, and we had gotten back to his place in Boston, he told me howuncomfortable he had been in that heterosexual atmosphere. The house itselfhad been full of lesbians, and he has no problem with that, but the neighborhoodreeked for him of the assumption of family. This frightened me. I hadn'tseen how easily I hid when I bought condoms at the store or took out gaybooks at the library. A few moments of suspicion by strangers against acontinual inner feeling of not belonging there. For me going to a gay areais a charged experience, for him it's going home.Rob Bernardo calls this disenfranchisement.By the bye, Rob, thank you for your excellent article.It brought me near to tears.There are similar but different kinds of loneliness and laughter for bisexuals,but the terror of AIDS is there for us all.P. HANSON also asks:Is being bisexual neverto be happy? To satisfy both sexual preferences nearly eliminates thepossibility of a monogamous relationship. And to have a monogamousrelationship implies a sort of celebacy. Or does it?and Rob Bernardo suggests a logical narrowing by distinguishing those withthe problem because they have ""separate sexual desires for males and females""from those who do not because they have ""a single sexual desire that can besatisfied by both males and females.""Well, a lot of things were going on when my girlfriend and I agreed on theidea of me having a boyfriend too. One of them was that I would just beventing excess sexual energy with a man (single desire theory). Anotherwas that it wouldn't be as threatening to our relationship since it was onlya man (single desire theory, since I'm more attracted to women). Anotherwas that it would give me a chance to explore my homosexuality (separatedesire theory, but also how to hide desires for nonmonogamy under the labelof bisexuality).Then there is the experience itself and I have to put it in both categories.(I know, I know, bisexuals are that way because they can't make choices.)The stubble on my boyfriend's cheek excites me in a different way than thefuzz on my girlfriend's cheek. On the other cheek, biting their calipygouscheeks gives me quite similar pleasure.No, I don't think that being bisexual is never to be happy. While I wasmonogamous, I enjoyed other men and women from a distance. Now whileI'm not, it feels like I am always happy. I expect that I'll settle downto the safer haven of monogamy with someone again, this time with an evengreater appreciation of how attractive everyone is.Are there any married bisexuals out there? (P. HANSON)Yes. Not me, although I was married for 14 years. I was very straight then.I belong to the Boston Bisexual Men's Network. I would say that half of usare married or in primary relationships with women. We have had discussionsand videotapes of the television shows on the special problems of marriedbisexuals, and one of the subgroups which meets more frequently is of marriedbisexuals.

Fredricks claimed that the symptoms of arthritis could be eliminatedor substantially reduced by complete elimination of the foods of thenightshade family from the diet. There were 5 items mentioned. Three ofthem were potatoes, tomatoes, and rutabaga. I don't remember the other two.Potatoes and tomatoes might take a little doing to eliminate (spaghetti,lasagna, pizza, etc.) but it seemed to me that someone in the grip ofarthritis would regard that as a small price to pay for substantial relief.The other two items were even less common than rutabaga.2. Fredricks related the story that if a farmer had a cow that couldn'tconceive and called the vet, the first thing the vet would ask is ""What'sthe animal been eating?""

Thousands of rats had to beinjected,to obtain a sufficient # of survivors to run a significantstudy, which required several months of time. Finally, when enoughhad been collected, the researcher divided them up into two matchedgroups.

Perhaps he does not realize that, in fact,physicians and scientists and their families and loved ones die of cancerjust like everybody else.I received no joy in watching my mother suffer from breast cancer whenI was a young man. The last words I ever heard her speak were to askour pastor if it was a sin to pray for death. I received no joy inwatching other friends, relatives, and mentors pass on, cut down bydiseases for which there are no cures.Mr. Stanions is as wrong as he is insensitive. We who tryto find cures for disease are not in it just for the bucks, and ifhe would bother to do some trivial self-education before blastingaway indiscriminately with his vacuous pedantic slander, he would knowthat we have made phenomenal strides. Look at Hodgkins disease,look at germ cell tumors such as choriocarcinoma. You don`t treatcancer with wheat germ and aloe vera; you use tested and rationalapproaches and you keep looking for a better understanding of thebases of disease to design protocols for prevention and cure.I sincerely hope that even Mr. Stanions will see a surgeon when hegets his skin cancer or prostate cancer should he live that long.One of the first diagnoses of cancer I ever made was on a man whohad squamous cell carcinoma of the skin - a disease which is 100%curable if found in a reasonable amount of time. This fellow feltthat all doctors were just out for money and didn`t know shit, sojust let the little spot on his hand grow to the size of a baseball.By the time his family forced him to give up his herbal salves anddietary trivialities, he had allowed the cancer, probably the mosttreatable cancer around, to spread to his brain, lungs, and liver.He had effectively commited suicide.I would be just as happy using my talents to find a cure for aging.Let me tell you, as soon as people find a general cure for cancerif there is one, they will have no more trouble finding fundingfor the cure of the disease that will replace it as a greatkiller than they had in finding funding for the treatment ofcancer beforehand. I would just as soon try to findways to allow people live to be 200 as to try to figure waysof helping them reach 70.I have done my best to stay out of these discussions about""natural"" medicine, since they reduce so quickly to statementsof faith and magic by those who decry conventional medicine.

The useof the phrase 'natural medicine' implies that practices that do notadhere to a certain naturalistic philosophy are in some sense suspect.Thus we have 'natural nutrition' opposed to 'artificial nutrition,' sothat a vitamin cooked up in a laboratory is missing some vital essencethat's present in an otherwise identical vitamin that occursnaturally. Go to your local health food store: you'll see 'natural'sources of minerals like calcium available.The suggestion is that calcium from a source like bone meal ordolomite will contribute to health more efficiently or effectivelythan the identical mineral that has somehow suffered humanintervention and thus been 'contaminated.' Or perhaps certain thingshave been removed by processing; we know that brown rice has morenutrients than polished rice, so perhaps naturally occurring calciumhas associated with it some trace compounds that processing removesand that science doesn't know about yet.It seems to me that both viewpoints are based on the notion of a Fallfrom Grace: that humanity in turning to technology for solutions toits problems has turned its back on the Garden in a kind ofself-imposed exile. The 'natural' ideologues ask us to reject thefalse knowledge we've acquired the past few hundred years, admit ourignorance, and return to an idealized 'natural' state that involvesthe rejection of technological solutions and the development of Faithin either an evolved world whose complexity and subtlety will foreverremain beyond us or a God who has ordered a world in our own bestinterests. In either case there's a sense that the cardinal sin ofPride is behind our technological advances, and that the fall occurredwhen the first hominid shaped the first bone club on the Africanplains (or in the Garden, depending on the religious basis of one'sFaith in 'natural' medicine). Note for example how often these peoplejump on any evidence that ordinary medicine has made factual orjudgement errors, evidence that Science can't after all be trusted sowe must place our Faith in something else.Science sees the world as a text whose meaning yields toexperimentation and rational examination.

What's a poor net.medreader to do?The key here, of course, is that no one has to be swayed by rhetoric: wordshave no special power in this discussion; this is not a debating contest.Whoever has the last word before quitting from exhaustion doesn'tnecessarily win. Luckily, there is a more powerful tool at hand, and ithas been mentioned again and again: the scientific method as the solecriterion for determing the appropriateness of a therapy. And, indeed,note that S&S have NOT ever attempted to discredit this approach. Rather,they cloak their own comments in the thin-skin of pseudo-science, makingstatements which APPEAR scientific, but dissolve upon cross-examination asbeing unproven and grounded in totally unscientific principles. WitnessStanions' latest straight-faced case-history: ""patient dying of accute[sic.] constipation..."" Indeed! I could quote at length, but all youneed do is reread their earlier contributions to net.med to understand this.Stanions and Stoll would make wonderful revival-tent preachers, for theircapacity for ""testimony"" is unsurpassed. What they forget, and what isimportant for all confused net.med readers to understand, is that the humanbody is remarkably resilient. Left alone, the great majority of people whoseek medical treatment (note, I didn't say 'who have diseases') tend tofeel better on their own, without any treatment other than time. Ofcourse, there is always the sorrowful 10-30% who DON'T, but those aretoo few to overcome the remarkable ability of humans for self-deception.If 70% of MY patients got well, I'd probably think I was going a good job,too. But, as you see, this statistic means nothing. It is the impersonalityand impartiality of the scientific study, and the careful analysis of data,which truly indicates whether ANY therapy is effective. And, this isthe cornerstone of modern medical practice.Note how S&S have ignored these important points raised in earlierresponses to their postings. Note how they prefer to make unsubstantiatedstatements as argument, as if merely saying something often enough and loudenough makes it true. Note how they misapply logic (as in the ""stress""studies) to further their argument. Note the similarity between theirbehavior and other pseudo-scientists (take a peek in net.origins for asense of deja-vu.) If Stanions and Stoll truly cared to see their practicesaccepted by the ""establishment"", they should be prepared to give them thesame scrutiny that the ""establishment"" gives theirs, and this meanspublication in refereed journals, and an experimental design which leads tounambiguous and reproducable results. Perhaps they'll claim that""reputable"" journals won't have anything to do with them. Perhaps, perhapsnot. But the wonderful thing about a well-designed scientific study isthat the results of the study would be hard to ignore, REGARDLESS of whereit appeared.

And, in fact, the two issues are completely orthogonal to eachother: high-tech need not mean dehumanized-intubated-zombie-on-life-support,so PLEASE let's not obscure the discussion. I would also disagree that anyoneis proposing ""limitless rationality"", unless you feel that the human body anddisease processes are somehow outside the laws of physics, chemistry,biochemistry and biology. Rather, this is the ""ordinary rationality"" whicheveryone uses in interacting with the material world.When you get into your car, you fill it with gas and the car starts. After awhile you need to fill up again. Your ordinary experience is completelyconsistent with the ""rationally-derived"" laws of physics and thermodynamics.When you read in the Enquirer about a 200 MPG ""super carburetor"" for only$149.95, you might naturally be suspicious, especially when you areconsidering, say, a trip across Death Valley. Better not to give it a try.Is this an unfair, rigid, ""limitless rationality""? You tell me.

You tell me.> I think we can also recognize that immature fields of study> are more easily criticized (because of low credibility, and because of> errors as well).Absolutely correct, though it supports the OPPOSITE point I think you aretrying to make. No one is more ready to recognize the limitations ofscientific knowledge about the human body than the practitioners of medicine.Medical practitioners try to make the best use of what they do know whentreaing a person. But it is only in fields which are immature and haveincomplete knowledge where crackpots and faddists flourish. Most peoplewould laugh-off the carburetor example I mentioned above. There are nomore people promoting outlandish ""flying machines"", because the physics ofmanned flight are so well understood. Medicine is certainly not at thesame level of knowledge and understanding, but there is no reasonwhatsoever that it should disassociate itself from scientific materialismto embrace the irrational: the progress we have made in the last 125 yearsis a direct result of the application of scientific knowledge to medicalproblems.--/Steve Dyer{harvard,seismo}!bbnccv!bbncc5!sdyersd...@bbncc5.ARPA",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/yDDbQj3XAV0/m/Txxzl0yu8eoJ,,,

The same amount of glucose ingested in an unrefined state (in other words, with all the 48+ nutrients it grew up with--in the exact proportion that it existed in nature) causes no reduction in the phagocytic index. You know, a grain of wheat is alive. No matter how long it is in storage it is slowly running its own ""Krebs cycle""(the same metabolic cycle we humans use to process all forms of carbohydrates). Those 48+ nutrients are present in the exact proportion, and in the exact amount, necessary to digest exactly the amount of carbohydrate in that grain of wheat. Nature is pretty tidy that way. If we eat the grain of wheat as it is we get everything needed to metabolize exactly that much starch. If we allow the food processors to remove the 48+ nutrients first, then, when we eat the refined product, our bodies must take those 48+ nutrients from storage in order to run the ""Krebs Cycle"". So long as a certain % of refined foods is not exceeded the human has reserves enough to get along. The best estimate by those who have taken the time to understand the field (so far as we do understand it) is that we can tolerate about 15% of our carbohydrates refined. Above 15%, even with our presently available crude measuring techniques, measurable decreases in function occur. The present average in this country is 60% refined & increasing every year. We have but to look at comparable statistics from Guam (which has persistantly led our % here in the US by about 5 years--presently 65%+) to see what we can expect of our future chronic disease incidence. The problem is not a lack of research data but the unwillingness to accept things that hit so close home as our own eating habits--one of the most personal of things. cbosgd!ukma!wws(Walt Stoll) -- Walt Stoll, MD, ABFP Founder, & Medical Director Holistic Medical Centre 1412 N.

It was a detailed account of the Babets-Jean case (the gay fosterparents in question) which included interviews.The Massachusetts ACLU and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders are ""pre-paring a legal challenge"" that ""will focus on two issues: equal protectionfor homosexuals...and the state's interpretation of the `best interest ofthe child.'""Meanwhile the New Hampshire legislature continues to prepare a law thatwould explicitly ban ""known homosexuals"" from foster care, guardianship,or adoption. The Massachusetts policy/proposed bill only gives priorityto ""traditional families.""The Boston gay newspaper Bay Windows published an odd letter from Gov.Michael Dukakis a while ago: the Duke was very solicitous, pledgingsupport for the state gay rights bill (a first for him), regrettingthe treatment of Babets & Jean and opposing homophobia. He ended byreiterating his support of the foster care policy change (which putsgays at the bottom of the foster parent preference list)! An amazingperformance. My guess is his stonewall (a la Nixon, not the riot)attitude toward gay outrage (""How many gay voters are there, anyway?""he'd been reported as saying) has crumbled somewhat, not least due tothe zaps staged every time he appears in public (they continue, butI have no news; does anyone else?).Regards,Ron Rizzo",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/NB_zOSZvP_E/m/WTCHWCoOT0QJ,,,

If I pay more than you do for insurance, thenI have greater expense than you do. My costs are not perfectly shared.While it is true that in our present economy there are differentialrates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true thatmost of the time the people paying more for coverage are stillgetting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only timecosts are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the sameamount without regard to costs generated. Any thing else is acompromise. (This is probably a point that is not releventto the real world, perfection is rare in it ...)BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assignedto a separate insurance pool.' It would seem to me that the actof segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting meinto a separate insurance pool... Or are you saying that an insurancepool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?Let me try a different model for explaination. The purpose ofinsurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed. If allcosts were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number ofpeople, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs addedbased on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.(So far, so good, I hope ) At this point I claim that the imperfectsharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra thatan individual must pay due to risk factors. Admitedly a very small amountcompared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one istotaly uninsured.The only way that I can see where this would not be true would bethe following. If the definition of insurance is not taken to be thesharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed costfor some unknown variable cost. Then it would not matter that thecosts were unequally shared. The only important point would be thatthere was a known rather than unknown cost. The known cost could varyby individual yet still be 'insurance'. However, the underlyingmechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing ofcosts over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definitionto be the best on.(Sorry about the length of this. I hope that by making one longexplaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds ofmissunderstandings...)--E.

As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount ofFICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have nodependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spousewho could continue to collect benefits after my death. FICA Tax is thesame for all. (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has nobearing on this issue.) FICA is a form of insurance.Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping thatthe insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal lifeinsurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to aripe old age.And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have aneducated population in the future. (No flames about the quality ofpublic schools today please!) My school taxes are not any less or morebecause I am single and have no children to send to school.I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 thisyear) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires suchprograms. I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfairwhen it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our socialservices system and it is not about to be changed. And while I stronglysupport the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-tial in retirement benefits.These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniformwithout respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status. Why thenshould we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomesa disease which affects the heterosexual population in the sameratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affectedas often as males. This is becoming the situation in 6 Africancountries today.I don't choose to get a deadly disease any more or any less than Ichoose not to get married.j.r. {allegra,seismo}!rochester!ritcv!jrc",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/NB_zOSZvP_E/m/XPidyA0XuicJ,,,

The purpose of insurance for the customeris the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost. The underlyingmechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"". It dependson laws of statistics. If there is an insurance pool with fixed assetswith one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis ofrisk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to thecompany will be predictable. As a matter of fact, this predictabilitydeteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equallyamong the customers. An insurance company achieves the mostpredictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordancewith the probability it will have to pay out. Imagine if you willa life insurance company run according to your philosophy. Everyonepays the same rate, regardless of risk. All 90 year olds, terminalcancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up. Deny them coverage, yousay. O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.sign up, etc. Your insurance company would go down the tubes unlessit limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, thepredictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to mycompany, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportionalto perceived risk.--Bill Tanenbaum - AT&T Bell Labs - Naperville IL ihnp4!ihlpg!tan",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/NB_zOSZvP_E/m/jrP-Ez6-zqsJ,,,

For those of you not fortunate enough to live within his zone of syndication, Arthur Hoppe is the political satirist in the San Francisco Chronicle. He is usually on target & quite funny, but sometimes (esp. lately) his sense of humor flags with his reaction to the world around him. Unannounced & unpermitted, I forward for your examination his column for today (10Sep). I DO hope that only ONE copy of this shows up at any given site & that it's legible; this editor & I have had to throw away 3 of these already!! ""The New Lepers"" It was at a party. I had filled my glass at the bar and turned. Behind me was a middle-aged man I had known for several years. I don't know him well. We had talked several times. He is a gentle, soft-spoken soul and I like him. A month or so ago, I heard he had AIDS. I thought of calling or writing him, but what do you say? And now here he was. He held out his hand. For a fraction of a second, I involuntarily hesitated. Then, of course, I shook it. If he does have AIDS, I can only pray that he didn't notice that flicker of hesitation. I am deeply ashamed of it. I can think of nothing more dishonorable than to fail to offer your hand to a dying man. Only the day before, a dear friend who is a reasonable sort demanded to know why ""the newspapers didn't print the truth about AIDS"" - primarily about what a danger AIDS poses to the middle-class heterosexual community. ""I was at dinner the other night and we spent at least an hour talking about nothing else,"" he said, and there was a hint of fear and anger in his voice. I tried to tell him that for the last couple of years newspapers have gone out of their way to publish stories about AIDS and their message was precisely the opposite: every recorded case of AIDS has been the result of the virus being transmitted into the bloodstream either by contaminated blood or contaminated semen. There is no other known way to contract the disease. I don't think he heard me. I don't think people are listening. I think they are too unreasonably scared. ""The food's good,"" said a woman I know, talking about a restaurant she no longer frequents because many of the waiters are gay, ""but why take chances?"" ""My heart goes out to him,"" a mother was quoted as saying in a news story about a young pupil who had AIDS, ""but I wouldn't feel right letting my child be in his classroom."" In San Francisco, city officials denounced as ""a cruel hoax"" notices falsely claiming that AIDS patients would be quarantined in remote loca- tions. Yet at least some gays took it seriously. And rightly so. From most reports, gays are being increasingly evicted, fired and ostracized as the disease spreads increasingly among them and the heterosexual community becomes increasingly frightened. It's no wonder gays refuse to give their names when taking tests for AIDS. If I were gay, I wouldn't want my name on any list. There's not much harm now, but if no cure is found and if the disease and the fear continue their exponential growth... I keep thinking about leprosy. We used to ring bells and shout, ""Unclean!"" when we saw a leper coming, or lock them up in deplorable colonies for the rest of their lives. We knew that their very touch would make us lepers too. Today, we have learned that leprosy is transmitted only through prolonged, intimate exposure. We now call it ""Hansen's disease"" and treat its victims as out-patients. They walk among us posing no more danger than a stranger with AIDS. I like to believe that the human race is getting better over the millenia. Aftr all, that hope is our only chance of survival in a nuclear age. So I can only pray that we react more reasonably to an unreasonable fear this time around. Thus I'm afraid - not of AIDS, but of our reaction to it. Your reaction and mine. And if a dying friend of mine reads this, I hope he will forgive me.

You can't get AIDS unless your immune system is near collapse. These people were exposed to the virus and their resistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create the carrier state. PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG! The ""incubation period"" is just the carrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enough for him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to do with an incubation period in the usual sense of the word. In this sense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack people with an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system until something lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again. If the Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does) instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS. Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lots more hysterical things will have to occur; before people have suffered enough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way. It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the human animal: it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony or disaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift in perception is tried. There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learned every week. The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS. As I stated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from all sides): Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week, practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps 20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock, Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire's Disease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example of specific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], Chronic Systemic Candidiasis, etc. There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have gone into remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply by following what I have reported to you above. There is still no conventional treatment that has any significant positive results. What harm is there to try? There can not possibly be any harm &, even common sense says it should help. Why so much resistance? Any one who has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings in this area. I believe it is hard because no one really wants to change their lifestyle. Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be an admission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before you got it, helped you get it. That is a pretty heavy burden for anyone to swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick. The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be. There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holistic understanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly the present outline I've been sharing with you.

As he says, it can't hurt and may be helpful. The only reservation is for those who follow his logic to its ultimate conclusion: that by following such ""common-sense"" prescriptions, one need not fear exposure to the virus, and hence drop other precautions. For some gay men, this means once again indulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchange of fluids which may contain the virus. This is imprudent, to say the least, but by Walt's theory, it is just fine. This is the only reason he is being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome of exposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally. One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is now dying of KS. The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune system directly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves. There is no evidence that such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind of infectious disease, despite his confident assurances. He is dealing in black and white when all of us are little real numbers along some still poorly characterized line of susceptibility.

Still, 1 out of 13,000 cases isn't a very high incidence (if anyone wants a reference to the incidence in question, mail to me and I'll go look it up).

A recent article in the San Francisco Chronicle about aids quoted a spokesperson for the CDC in Atlanta as saying that they had followed over 400 health care workers who had come into close contact with body fluids from AIDs patients and that none of the workers showed evidence of the AIDs virus. That is why I got so uptight about the ""my internist"" reference. However one person sent me mail indicating that the Scientific American ran a story about infected health workers. I don't subscribe to that mag so if someone could look it up and post the quote I would appreciate it. And to the person who sent me mail from an ""unverified terminal"" (whatever that is) saying that I seem to feel that AIDs is only sexually transmitted - a loud no. I believe AIDs is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids, e.g. blood and semen.

Not one has yet developed AIDS, or AIDS- related complex (ARC). Of those tested, none has tested Antibody Positive for HTLV-3. There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in the United States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, so probably didn't get AIDS through work. The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself with a substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normal needle stick. She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks after the incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data to determine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - for Lymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS and ARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, one can't say she ever had AIDS at all. The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much more facile from men to women than from women to men. I swear I saw a reference that said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-male heterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to- male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulous at the time. No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in saliva or tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in only a small minority of people with AIDS. There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after the first month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it is probably an infection in-utero). That is probably the best indication of the virus' relative non-infectability. -- Craig Werner !philabs!aecom!werner ""What do you expect?

I know that the blood banks are nowtesting donor blood. I can see the reason for that. However, the test isoften wrong.If my blood tests positive, will they inform me about it? If so, how?Who else will be informed? (An especially interesting question--sinceI give through a program at work.) Must I pay for the extra tests to confirmor invalidate their positive test? It seems to me that if their test wasmistaken, I shouldn't be made to pay. (Beyond being scared shitless, ofcourse! I have visions of thousands of people sueing them for pain andsuffering.) Suppose I test false positive--can I be reinstated as a blooddonor when the incorrectness of their test is confirmed? I would like togive blood if possible--but if they don't want my blood, even for an invalidreason, do I have any recourse? Or, if they act badly, should I even care?As an aside, it seems to me that there are some issues connected with thesetests on which straights, (or bi's like me) should really be siding withthe gay community--like who gets told about your positive test, and howsociety treats you (i.e. keeping you out of school or work). Obviously,given the information quoted, this could happen to anyone. And it is mostlikely, with a false positive, to happen to those people who care aboutothers enough to give blood since they will be tested often. Given theirrational, lynching attitude I've seen, this could really mess up a person'slife. And of course, it's even worse with a true positive, because you needsupport even more in that situation. But I don't see people caring. Iwonder how many people will have to be hurt before people do care.

You can't get AIDS unless your immune system isnear collapse. These people were exposed to the virus and theirresistance was sufficient to either kill off the virus or create thecarrier state. PRECISELY AS THE AMERICAN HOLISTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONHAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG! The ""incubation period"" is just thecarrier state intil the individual's reserves finally got low enoughfor him or her to finally yield to the virus--it has nothing to dowith an incubation period in the usual sense of the word. In thissense it is like Herpes [which also, by the way, doesn't attack peoplewith an unburdened immune system]--it stays in the system untilsomething lowers the immunity enough for it to break out again. Ifthe Herpes virus attacked the immune system (like the AIDS virus does)instead of the skin, it would be just as bad as AIDS.Unfortunately, many more people will have to get the disease; lotsmore hysterical things will have to occur; before people have sufferedenough to be willing to look at the situation in a very different way.It has always amazed me how painful thinking seems to be for the humananimal: it will do almost anything, suffer almost any agony ordisaster before, finally (as a last resort) thoughtful shift inperception is tried.There are more ways , to improve the immune system, being learnedevery week. The thinking human is NOT helpless before AIDS. As Istated a few weeks ago (the position for which I was blasted from allsides): Anyone who does aerobic exercise 20 minutes 3 times/week,practices a whole food diet & switches their hypothalamus to 8-10cps20 minutes twice daily, has nothing to fear from AIDS, Toxic Shock,Legioniare's Disease (did you know one couldn't get Legionaire'sDisease unless they were, or had been, a smoker?)[another example ofspecific stresses exceeding reserves within the individual], ChronicSystemic Candidiasis, etc.There have been several recorded cases of AIDS already that have goneinto remission (possibly to cure--too soon to know yet) simply byfollowing what I have reported to you above. There is still noconventional treatment that has any significant positive results.What harm is there to try? There can not possibly be any harm &, evencommon sense says it should help. Why so much resistance? Any onewho has done their homework knows about the laboratory findings inthis area. I believe it is hard because no one really wants to changetheir lifestyle. Besides, if you have AIDS, changing would be anadmission that something that you did, in your lifestyle before yougot it, helped you get it. That is a pretty heavy burden for anyoneto swallow, especially if one is already pretty sick.The truth will eventually out, regardless what we would LIKE it to be.There may be some fine detail things to learn about what the Holisticunderstanding has been for some time---but it will follow exactly thepresent outline I've been sharing with you.My thanks to Ron Ringo for placing the information on the net.

As hesays, it can't hurt and may be helpful. The only reservation is for thosewho follow his logic to its ultimate conclusion: that by following such""common-sense"" prescriptions, one need not fear exposure to the virus, andhence drop other precautions. For some gay men, this means once againindulging in frequent, promiscuous sex practices which involve the exchangeof fluids which may contain the virus. This is imprudent, to say theleast, but by Walt's theory, it is just fine. This is the only reason heis being ""blasted"", for he is confidently predicting the outcome ofexposure to a virus about which still little is known experimentally.One wonders what he'd say to a formerly ""healthy"" athlete who is nowdying of KS.The trouble is, one cannot predict the state of one's immune systemdirectly from diet and exercise and alpha brainwaves. There is no evidencethat such behaviors provide absolute protection against any kind ofinfectious disease, despite his confident assurances. He is dealing inblack and white when all of us are little real numbers along some stillpoorly characterized line of susceptibility.

Of those tested, none has tested Antibody Positivefor HTLV-3.There are about a dozen cases of health workers getting AIDS in theUnited States, but these people all turned out to have other risk factors, soprobably didn't get AIDS through work.The oft-cited case of the English nurse who injected herself witha substantial amount of arterial blood from an AIDS patient was no normalneedle stick. She developed generalized Lymphadenopathy several weeks afterthe incident, which later got better. I have not seen any antibody data todetermine whether she was actually infected by HTLV-3 (also called LAV - forLymphadenopathy Virus). However, even though this is a symptom of AIDS andARC, several other things can cause it, and in the absence of the data, onecan't say she ever had AIDS at all.The heterosexual transmission of the disease seems to be much morefacile from men to women than from women to men. I swear I saw a referencethat said that only 2 cases in NY are definitely ascribed to female-to-maleheterosexual contact (ruling out IV drug abuse - which transmits female-to-male quite well.) However I can't find it now, but I remember being incredulousat the time.No known cases are ascribed to transmission by the virus in salivaor tears. For one, it is in those fluids in very small amounts, and in onlya small minority of people with AIDS.There is no case of a child catching AIDS from its mother after thefirst month of life (and that wording just hedges on the fact that it isprobably an infection in-utero).

Donors will then be told they will be told of irregularities. ...If the test proves positive the first time, it will be held so it doesn't get used for transfusion. It will be re-tested a number of times and if the results are still positive, the blood will be sent to the Red Cross's central laboratory for further tests. If those tests are positive, donors will be informed that for an un-specified reason, their blood cannot be used and no further donations will be accepted. The Red Cross will then ask the donor to name a physician to send test results to. ...Panelist Dr. Penny Ballem, deputy director of the B.C. and Yukon blood transfusion service, said the number of false positives may be as high as eight in a 1,000. The concern is that those who are false positives will unnecessarily be faced with fear and trauma over the possibility that they could develop the fata acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Panelist Dr. Paul Volberding, director of the AIDS clinic in San Francisco, said donors should be informed. While there is concern about false positives, most of them are women.

Times, there was an article which said that some insurance companies in Wisconsin are considering eliminating coverage for AIDS in health insurance plans. This was a response to the law passed in Wisconsin which restricted use of blood tests results by insurers. The insurance companies justification was that it would be unfair to those who did release results if they provided coverage to others who didn't. Since they were prohibited from denying coverage on the basis of test results or lack thereof, they decided to eliminate all coverage. This strikes me as a rather vindictive move, but it shows that perhaps simply legislating restrictions on the insurance companies may not be the answer. Have you ever tried to get insurance which covers nuclear reactor accidents? It may be even harder to get AIDS coverage in a few years.

If I pay more than you do for insurance, thenI have greater expense than you do. My costs are not perfectly shared.While it is true that in our present economy there are differentialrates based on a variety of 'risk factors' and while it is true thatmost of the time the people paying more for coverage are stillgetting some sharing of costs; it is also true that the only timecosts are perfectly shared is when all parties pay the sameamount without regard to costs generated. Any thing else is acompromise. (This is probably a point that is not releventto the real world, perfection is rare in it ...)BTW, I am confused by the statement '...correct only if ... assignedto a separate insurance pool.' It would seem to me that the actof segregating me into a different rate group *is* putting meinto a separate insurance pool... Or are you saying that an insurancepool is a given asset base from which insurance can be paid?Let me try a different model for explaination. The purpose ofinsurance is to share cost, on that I think we have agreed. If allcosts were summed, then shared equally, we would have perfect sharing.If all costs were summed, then divided equally by the number ofpeople, then some people had costs deducted while others had costs addedbased on some 'risk factors', we would have imperfect sharing.(So far, so good, I hope ) At this point I claim that the imperfectsharing is a reduction of the 'insurance' by the amount extra thatan individual must pay due to risk factors. Admitedly a very small amountcompared to the potential magnetude of individual costs if one istotaly uninsured.The only way that I can see where this would not be true would bethe following. If the definition of insurance is not taken to be thesharing of costs, but rather the substitution of *some known* fixed costfor some unknown variable cost. Then it would not matter that thecosts were unequally shared. The only important point would be thatthere was a known rather than unknown cost. The known cost could varyby individual yet still be 'insurance'. However, the underlyingmechanism by which insurance companies work depends on the sharing ofcosts over a large group, so I would hold the cost sharing definitionto be the best on.(Sorry about the length of this. I hope that by making one longexplaination of my position we can avoid several dozen rounds ofmissunderstandings...)--E.

As an unmarried person, I pay the same amount ofFICA (Social Security) Tax as a married person even though I have nodependents who would benefit if I died prematurely, nor do I have a spousewho could continue to collect benefits after my death. FICA Tax is thesame for all. (NO - don't bring up the two-income family, that has nobearing on this issue.) FICA is a form of insurance.Today, my future retirement benefits are determined irrespective of sex.Retirement plans are a form of life insurance except the insurer is hoping thatthe insured ""kicks the bucket"" early rather than with the normal lifeinsurance situation where the insurance company wants you to live to aripe old age.And what about another form of insurance - to insure that we have aneducated population in the future. (No flames about the quality ofpublic schools today please!) My school taxes are not any less or morebecause I am single and have no children to send to school.I have never objected to paying my school taxes (in excess of $1,200 thisyear) as I have always felt that to maintain a society requires suchprograms. I must admit that I have felt that the FICA system is unfairwhen it comes to potential benefits, but it is a part of our socialservices system and it is not about to be changed. And while I stronglysupport the Feminine Movement, selfishly I would like to see a differen-tial in retirement benefits.These are just three examples when ""insurance"" premiums are uniformwithout respect to age, sex, and marital (family) status. Why thenshould we not extend this same philosophy to other forms of insurance!As an aside, I wonder what will be your feelings when AIDS becomesa disease which affects the heterosexual population in the sameratio as the homosexual population, and when females are affectedas often as males.

You use it to mean ""sharing the costs equally"". Toavoid misunderstanding, I will use ""cost sharing"" in quotes tomean what you take it to mean.It is NOT TRUE that ""cost sharing"", in your usage of the term, isthe purpose of insurance. The purpose of insurance for the customeris the substitution of a fixed cost for a variable cost. The underlyingmechanism of insurance does NOT depend on ""cost sharing"". It dependson laws of statistics. If there is an insurance pool with fixed assetswith one million customers, the costs can be prorated on the basis ofrisk, with great assurance that the total cost in benefits to thecompany will be predictable. As a matter of fact, this predictabilitydeteriorates, rather than improves, if the ""costs"" are shared equallyamong the customers. An insurance company achieves the mostpredictability in benefit payout when it assigns its rates in accordancewith the probability it will have to pay out. Imagine if you willa life insurance company run according to your philosophy. Everyonepays the same rate, regardless of risk. All 90 year olds, terminalcancer patients, AIDS victims, etc. sign up. Deny them coverage, yousay. O. K., all 80 year olds, heart patients, diabetes victims, etc.sign up, etc. Your insurance company would go down the tubes unlessit limited itself to covering people of the same age and general health.Even then, because of your reduced number of customers, thepredictability of total benefit payout would be reduced compared to mycompany, which insures almost everybody, but with premiums proportionalto perceived risk.--Bill Tanenbaum - AT&T Bell Labs - Naperville IL ihnp4!ihlpg!tan",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/NB_zOSZvP_E/m/jrP-Ez6-zqsJ,,,

Some good material---a littlebetter than the Enquirer's coverage---particularly with regard tocatching the disease through casual contact. On the other hand, as soonas New York enters the bedroom things go a little haywire. There are afew choice nuggets: a sidebar labelled THE NEW SEXUAL ETIQUETTE advises:``If you're a single woman, remember---no casual sex ever again,'' saysone expert. ``Know your partner. Know whether he ever had a homosexualexperience or used injected drugs in the past eight years.''One unworthy identified only as ``Kaplan of the Human Sexuality Programat the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center'' [ I assume he wears atrenchcoat and introduces himself as ``Kaplan of the Center'' ] refersto ``these high-risk people, these Typhoid Marys''.

I can't say strongly enough that every person of whateversexual preference who has had more that one sexual partner since 1981should read these articles (all three). The _Harper's_ article isespecially good, in that it describes in great detail the history ofthe disease, what the ""clinical"" meaning of the term is, and describeshow the retrovirus LAV/HTLV-II works. It also discusses some issuesof burning concern to all oppressed people--like mass quarantine andpublic policy. The _ATlantic_ article spends much of its timediscussing how AIDS has affected San Francisco, and how it has shapedrecent public policy in SFO. But it also discusses how it affects thelives of the people who it touches. There have also been recenteditorial articles on AIDS in the British news weekly _The Economist_.I don't remember the issue dates, but I'm sure that there will be morein the future. _The Economist's_ articles give a uniquee will be morein the future. _The Economist's_ articles give a unique, Europeanperspective, that is quite intelligent.

However from there it spreads and pretty much convinces everyorgan to close shop.Lassa fever is one of the most deadliest and most contagious diseasesknown to man. It was first described in the early 70s by a group of ColumbiaU. researchers.The first epidemic started with a nurse called LW, who worked in amissionary hospital in the town of Lassa, in the Cameron foothills of Nigeria.After a week, unresponsive to antibiotics she was flown to a larger hospitalin Jos, where she died the next day.Within the next week, two out of three of her nurses were dead of thedisease, and a third was deathly ill. She was flown to New York (promptingseveral staff physicians at Columbia Presbyterian to leave the country :-) )and placed in isolation, where despite having a 107 degree fever for a week,survived and after several months in the hospital recovered.Meanwhile, one of the researchers returned to Nigeria to studyadditional cases. On Feb 18, 1970, 4 days after her paper describing theepidemic was accepted for publication, she died of Lassa fever herself,the first outbreak's final victim.(Source: Ten Diseases You Were Better Off Not Knowing About)( G.

Witha child having AIDS attending school, there is a muchgreater risk of the child catching what would normallybe a simple childhood disease and not being able tofight it off. Take chicken pox as an example. There oncewas a tribe of indians living in the area of northern Iowathat was wiped out after coming in contact with chicken pox.The same thing happened in the area of Easter Island some200 years ago. So, since chicken pox can kill thosewithout an immunity, the child with AIDS will have thesame problem. I feel that putting the child into thisenvironment would be a greater risk to the child thanthat supposed risk to those around the child. Shovinga child into the school based on principles is not helpingthe child or solving the problem. It is mearly satisfyingthe egos of some folks who have no real compassion forthe life of the child.T. C. Wheeler",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/Yx6HXihhKPM/m/yRGOS0Q282MJ,,,

The good news: The syndrome is apparently not transmitted through casual household contact and hence not among school children; health care workers who handle AIDS patients, even workers who have accidentally stuck themselves with needles, have little if any chance of becoming infected, according to researchers. The bad news: Heterosexual transmission, at least in Haiti and Africa, is becoming increasingly prevalent. And the surprising news: The virus associated with the disease may have been around as long ago as 1962. A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study of 101 members of households that included an AIDS sufferer shows transfer of infection only in one instance, in a baby born to an infected mother. ""From this study,"" says Martha F. Rogers of the CDC in Atlanta, who headed the study, ""our best estimate of the risk of household transmission is zero."" The belief that AIDS victims in schools can transmit the disease, she says, has no scientific basis in the data collected thus far. Three studies presented at the meeting show little if any risk to health care workers involved with AIDS patients. In a CDC study of 802 workers nationwide who had been exposed to AIDS blood or body fluids, only one person with no other risk factors was infected with the virus; of 527 health care workers in two prospective studies, only 1 of 95 workers who had accidentally stuck themselves with a needle, showd evidence of exposure. The incidence might be so low because it takes repeated exposures or an overworked immune system to allow the virus to establish itself, researchers suggested. Heterosexual transmission is establishing itself as a mode of infection in Haiti and Africa. In Haiti, 14 percent of AIDS victims in a 1980-1982 survey were women; thus far in 1985, 36 percent are women, reports Warren D. Johnson Jr., of Cornell Medical College in New York City. When the researchers questioned AIDS patients about recent deaths of spouses, they found 5 percent had spouses who died of confirmed AIDS and another 15 percent had died of what seemed to be AIDS. A study in Kenya, which has not reported a high AIDS incidence, shows the virus is establishing itself among prostitutes at an alarming rate. Of 64 women who served a ""lower class"" clientele, 42 had AIDS antibodies, while 8 of 26 with a ""higher class"" clientele had antibodies; no overt disease has yet been seen. Where the virus comes from remains to be solved, but a report at the meeting may add 10 years to its age. J.A. Epstein and colleagues at the Food and Drug Administration reported finding AIDS-specific antibodies in two of 544 blood samples collected in Upper Volta in 1963--10 years earlier than previously reported Ugandan samples (SN:3/16/86,p.173).

If a lung ashtray onlyserved to remind you of how much you wanted a cigarette, obviously mysuggestion is not going to work as a deterrent. My implication that""thinking smokers"" would be deterred is also disproven by yourobservations, since obviously you were thinking at the time you werereminded of how bad you wanted a cigarette. Apparently the desire fora cigarette is not a logically based desire, and attempts to deal withit logically (i.e., ""convince you it is harmful and you will quit"") willnot work.

When someone assails them with the ""Smoking isbad for you because..."" tirade, they think, ""Boy, this person thinksI'm so stupid that I don't know all of this. If he thinks I'm goingto pay any attention to such an arrogant and holier-than-thou jerk, he'sgot another think coming.""In other words, all that will happen if you spout off about the perilsof smoking is that you will totally discredit yourself in the eyes ofthe person that you're supposedly trying to help. (I say ""supposedly"",because there really are a lot of arrogant and holier-than-thou jerksout there who don't really want to help at all; they just want todenigrate smokers so that they'll feel superior).Okay, so what *can* you do? First, examine your own motives. Honestly.If you feel superior to those who smoke, then kindly keep your mouthshut (most ex-smokers fall into this category). Your conceited brayingis obvious to almost everyone, and smokers in particular find it down-right funny that you think that you're better than they are.If you don't like the idea that maybe smokers are actually *enjoying*doing something that you personally would never ever do, then you tooare requested to keep your notions to yourself and your kind.If you don't like being exposed to smoke, you might try the almostalways ignored route of simply asking the smokers that you deal with tobe considerate of you. Insist that restaurants have a non-smokingsection, since you can hardly be expected to ask every stranger atevery nearby table to be considerate. (It probably wouldn't work,anyway).If you're concerned about smoking as a ""public health menace"", thenconcentrate on *prevention*. A lot has already been done in this area,especially on television where ads have been banned and most charactersdon't smoke.If you are concerned about the health of someone special to you, thenyou have a difficult time ahead.

I'm sorry I can't give exact dates, but they were quite interesting. It does seem to me that the FDA positions are sorely lacking. It is one thing to have a half dozen or so tranquilizers on the market and want to be cautious about allowing a seventh on just because it may have a few less side effects. It is another thing to tell people that there is no known treatment that we have approved and you will have to accept your fate. The fact that some treatments being tried in other countries seem to show some promise is not factored in to the decision process (or so it seems). The WSJ observes that this mentality has resulted in a ""black market"" for what would normally be called ethical drugs (as distinguished from recreational drugs).

Tom Brokaw was a little stiff and uncom-fortable it seemed, and the questions selected for the AIDS researchersand administrators briefly interviewed (as well as some of the answers)were somewhat bizarre in what they emphasized and left out, given thepurported fear-allaying aim of the program. For example, when askeda fairly open-ended question about public fears, Harvard Medical'sHaseltine baldly stated that they were completely justified, period, withno further qualification or explanation! Worse: liberal Henry Waxman(D-Ca.), one of the staunchest supporters of both AIDS funding andcivil rights for gay people in the Congress, utterly collapsed inreplying to a similar broad query from Brokaw whether time-honoredbasic rights might be altered or curtailed to fight the epidemic:Waxman shockingly answered, ""Of course!"", with no further qualificationor comment, and then proceeded to disagree about a specific and absurdproposal that Newt Gingrich of Georgia, another interviewee believe itor not, had just raised, namely that everyone should be required by lawto carry ID cards recording how they'd tested for HTLV-III. Why theodd media ""doctrine of balance"" should require a Jesse Helms clone& rancid ideologue like Gingrich to make the case for curtailmentof rights when many other nonrabid and legally knowledgeable advocatesof such measures are available, I don't know.

It may save their lives and yours. Talk about this openly; it's a matter of life and death. If you love someone, you owe them honest communication about AIDS, even if you're not having sex with them. Especially bad is the thought that gay men are the most likely ""risk group"" to get AIDS. That simply isn't true. It's rapidly becoming clear that the main risk group is people who share needles and people who engage in sexual practices that exchange bodily fluids, usually through mucous membrance contact. The more peoples' membranes you contact, the more likely you are to get it. In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease. In Europe, AIDS is about half hetero, half gay male.

Another good source is the SF AIDS Foundation Hotline, 800-FOR-AIDS] Safe or very low risk: * Social (dry) kissing * Hugging * Body massage * Non-genital petting * Mutual Masturbation (penile, vaginal, clitoral) * Exhibitionism and Voyeurism (consensual) * S & M (without bruising or bleeding) * Using personal sex toys (don't share without sterilizing them) Possibly safe: * French (wet) kissing) * Fellatio without taking ejaculate (cock sucking -- no load) * Anal intercourse with condom (and spermicide) * Vaginal intercourse with condom (and spermicide) * Oral-vaginal sex (with spermicide) * Urine contact (""golden showers"" -- unbroken skin only) Unsafe: Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom Swallowing semen or taking it vaginally Oral-anal contact (rimming) Manual-anal contact (ass play) Use spermicides that contain nonoxynol-9 (look on the label). It kills the virus in quite low concentrations. If you're having trouble getting used to condoms, try playing with them when you masturbate.

Homosexuality is *natural* for us (as per one of my last postings). It's not even a pull. It is part of what I am, like being Chinese. Why should I have to justify what I am? God made me this way, and it is part of what I always have been, just as being heterosexual is part of hwat you always have been. I have to justify moral decisions, but being homosexual is merely part of my state; it was not a moral decision. Being gay is definitely *not* the easy path. Dealing with predjudice from people like you make it difficult sometimes. But honesty is among the highest virtues, therefore I choose to live what I am instead of conform to what others would want. > I simply reject your claim to the possession of a fulfill- > ing love/sex relationship of the same sex kind.

Up to now, it's neglectedAIDS, or carried short infrequent news items about it. The article'sbibliography cites papers dating from May-December 1984.The current ADVOCATE (#433, 11/12/85) has a ""travel piece"" by MichaelChaffee on Soviet Gays, in the USSR and US. (It contained an item Ifound interesting: the Soviet movie director Paradjanov (sp?) wasimprisoned because he is gay. Years ago on PBS I'd seen his mostfamous film, ""Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,"" a dreamlike taleabout the Gusuls (sp?), a Lapp-like hill tribe dwelling in the easternCarpathian mountains near Poland, the most beautiful Russian film I'veever seen, but I knew nothing about the director.)SEX & SCIENCEThe current GCN (11/23/85) has a good centerfold article by Scott Tucker,""Sex & Science: Who Decides What's Good For Us?"" which critically reviewsresearch on possible biological bases of sexual orientation and the oftenhomophobic presuppositions of researchers. Much of such ""science"" beginswith an assumption that homosexuality must be the result of a deviationin a biological process (prenatal stress, hormone balance, etc.). Sowhat else is new? What's new is that biotechnologies capable of alteringthe gender and sexual orientation of fetuses are now foreseeable in thenot-too-distant-future. The social implications of this were briefly butsharply debated in net.motss months ago. To me it's the most intriguingissue yet raised in this newsgroup, because it's so thorny.Recently AIDS hysteria has revived not only old prejudices but theiraccompanying superstitions about homosexuality. Even some scientistshave succumbed.Given the current vogue in social biology and evolutionary styles ofexplanation, I'm appending the following annotated bibliography of biologyessays that aim to demonstrate the naturalness of homosexuality. LikeMarxism and psychoanalysis, darwinism has often been used merely tojustify the status quo and is so broad an idea that it can be used tosupport almost any hypothesis and prove incapable of refutation. Never-theless, a number of scientists have made cogent use of it to examinepossible biological roles of ""nonreproductive sexuality.""(Andre Gide's turn-of-the-century apologia for homosexuality, CORYDON,is scientifically outdated, but it's devoted almost entirely to biologicalconsiderations, and is well-written and thought-provoking.)Below is a footnote (#9, page 9) from John Boswell's CHRISTIANITY, SOCIALTOLERANCE & HOMOSEXUALITY (1980, U. Chicago Press, $9.95 pb):[ Quoted without permission. ]In the late nineteenth century, when the issue of homosexuality firstbegan to exercise the minds of scientists, most authorities assumedthat homosexual inclinations were congenital, and differed only onwhether they were a defect (Kraft-Ebbing) or a part of the normal rangeof human variation (Hirschfeld). The triumph of psychoanalyticalapproaches to human sexual phenomena resulted in general abandonmentof this approach in favor of psychological explanations, but in 1959G. E. Hutchinson published a paper specualting on the possible geneticsignificance of ""nonreproductive"" sexuality (which he labeled ""para-philia""), including homosexuality (""A Speculative Consideration ofCertain Possible Forms of Sexual Selection in Man,"" AMERICAN NATURALIST93 [1959]: 81-91). In the 1970s a great deal of speculation hasfollowed on the evolutionary significance of homosexuality, much of itagreeing on the essential likelihood of genetic viability for homo-sexual feelings through one selection mechanism or another. A theorybased on parent-offspring conflict as a mechanism for producing homo-sexuality was published in 1974 by R. L. Trivers (""Parent-OffspringConflict,"" AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST 14 [1974]: 249-64). In 1975 E. O. Wilson(SOCIOBIOLOGY: THE NEW SYNTHESIS [Cambridge, Mass., 1975]) suggestedthat homosexuality might involve a form of genetic altruism, throughwhich gay people benefit those closely related to them and offsettheir lowered reproductivity (see pp. 22, 229-31, 281, 311, 343-44,and esp. 555). This argument was expanded and simplified in ""HumanDecency Is Animal,"" New York Times Magazine (October 12, 1975), pp.38ff. and in ON HUMAN NATURE (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), pp. 142-47.The most detailed and comprehensive study of this subject to date,examining nearly all modern theories for the etiology of homosexual-ity, is that of James D. Weinrich, ""Human Reproductive Strategy:The Importance of Income Unpredictability and the Evolution of Non-Reproduction,"" pt. 2 ""Homosexuality and Non-Reproduction: SomeEvolutionary Models"" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1976). Anextraordinarily lucid and readable summary of previous biologicalapproaches, with provocative original speculations, appeared in JohnKirsch and James Rodman, ""The Natural History of Homosexuality,""Yale Scientific Magazine 51, no. 3 (1977): 7-13.Cheers,Ron Rizzo""Humans are anmimals, but we are not rats.""-- Scott Tucker",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/I5YIBJiyahU/m/bTRgtAF26SIJ,,,

It is --and is likely to remain -- largely the fatal price one can payfor anal intercourse.""Inside is a rather confused mishmash of more of the same, along with somepretty good science writing on what is known about AIDS replication andtransmission which reads like it came out of a different article withoutan axe to grind. There is a subtle homophobia here, no less repugnant thanthe editorial page ravings of Cal Thomas and the Boston Globe's David Wilson.It is a reformation of Pat Buchanan's pet phrase, ""[gays] have transgressedagainst nature, and now they're reaping the fatal price"", clothed in a mantleof bioscience rather than religion. But it was bad religion, and so far,it remains bad science.The claim is that the vagina is a good shield against AIDS virus infectionor dissemination due to its intact epithelial structure, as opposed to theanus and the penile urethra which are far more vascular and open to viralinfection. These are interesting hypotheses, certainly worthy of continuedexploration, but they remain hypotheses, and no public health official hasever made as strong a statement as DISCOVER, trying to pass this off asestablished fact. It is interesting that this article comes out at thesame time that news reports have uncovered the extent of AIDS in sexuallyactive heterosexuals in Africa. This article discounts whatever earlierhad been reported as being wholly reducible to the practice ofscarification, a cosmetic procedure using unsanitized needles. Whypromiscuous heterosexual activity seems to be correlated with the incidenceof the disease in Africa certainly is unexplored by this article.The fact is that AIDS need not be the fatal consequence of anal intercourseand should not be identified as one and the same. It was safe for millionsof years, and though it may cause some Falwellians and science-backedhomophobes indigestion, one can presume that it (not to mention sex ingeneral) will once again be considered safe at some time in the future.It's curious that ""normal"" sexual intercourse was never singled out as theculprit when syphilis was considered a death sentence. Rather, the focuswas on the spirochete. Yet here we have a curious fascination with andcondemnation of a sexual practice favored by a minority of society. Rightnow all sexual practices which are open to the interchange of blood and/orsemen between non-monogamous individuals should be considered potentiallydangerous. At this point, it is foolhardy for promiscuous heterosexuals orgay people to take the DISCOVER report on face value to avoid takingreasonable safe-sex precautions in all forms of sexual expression.I am trying to make a very subtle point here, and I want to make sure I amnot being misinterpreted. My thesis is that there is a large politicalcomponent in the DISCOVER article which is intimately tied up with thetraditional revulsion of Western society towards homosexual activity ingeneral and anal intercourse in particular. Whatever data might have beenor might yet be collected regarding the role of anal sex in the etiology ofAIDS is being obscured by the force of this societal proscription, leading toovereager conclusions as yet unsupported by firm data, and to a focus on theact of anal sex itself, as it becomes transformed into an icon for the dreadedsyndrome. To anyone interested in seeing rationality drive a solution to theAIDS problem, this is very frightening.With that said, I must also admit that any AIDS research which focuses onthe role of particular sexual practices is necessarily BOUND to becontroversial since it encroaches on the larger societal ambivalencetowards them. But for me, this argues for even more careful reportingand an attention to conclusions unfettered by non-scientific moresand morals. The DISCOVER report, shamefully, fell far short of this goal.--/Steve Dyer{harvard,seismo}!bbnccv!bbncc5!sdyersd...@bbncc5.ARPA",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/I5YIBJiyahU/m/6hxfO0KUQaEJ,,,

Of course, hepatitis can also be transmitted via analintercourse through microsopic cuts in the penis or rectal wall.(And amoebas and other pathogens lurk in excrement, but are trans-mitted only through ingestion. Yet the urethra, vagina, and anusare fairly close to each other, and some of the same dangers lurkthere.) Condoms should reduce the risk of transmission by blood.If the above claim is true, then only gonorrhea can actually residein the rectum, while hepatitis and AIDS depend on immediate injectioninto the blood stream. Thus, a case can be made for the rectum being""naturally"" a healthier sexual receptacle than the vagina, or themouth for that matter.Some rectal and colonic cancers may originate sexually, but whetherviruses cause them is not (I think) either known or clear. On theother hand, the variety of cancers (of the cervix, vagina, etc.)and other serious or chronic diseases or damage resulting frommissionary-position heterosexual intercourse are legion and rela-tively well-known (but suffered by women, not men). I've alwaysmarvelled at the fact that these facts are never adduced to con-clude that heterosexuality, or a sexist use of it, is ""contranaturam,"" unnatural and punished by an avenging Nature.If the fixation on anal intercourse as culprit is a coded beliefthat AIDS is intrinsically a ""homosexual disease,"" then it shouldbe noted that the preferred homosexual practice of a prototypicalperiod such as classical Athens was intercrural (between the thighs)intercourse, while throughout for example Persian history, analintercourse was highly rated and frequently practiced among bothstraights and gays.Finally, even NBC's post-Early Frost news program, ""AIDS Fears,AIDS Facts"" solicited a disclaimer from one of the intervieweesthat AIDS will remain primarily a disease of ""high-risk groups""for the foreseeable future, even though the upshot of the restof the program was to warn everyone that it now threatens all.Dream on!Cheers,Ron Rizzo",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/I5YIBJiyahU/m/-gTl5Y_Qpu8J,,,

The reality was that it never happened, and he had to face that in actuality he was disappointed. >A net lolly pop writes me a private mail to the effect the I am a chauvinist >(me??? why I LOVE women - think they're ALL equal) and asks why I think >it is important for a man to have a woman to love, ""above all others on >earth"" (quoting me). And says I should be proud of homosexuals for choosing >the superior sex, blah, blah. Here Ken shows off his mysoginistic tendencys in such a way that no comment is necessary. >Other confused souls have written me from time to time asking 'where I'm >coming from' so to speak. And here it is ... the first signs that Ken is gonna get REAL with us.. >Wellllllll. (That sound is thousands of 'n' keys!) First he indulges in revving up his paranoia engines!! >Let's start with masturbation. (Ain't that where we all start?) I mean that >seriously. The 'self' starts with itself and moves outward seeking fulfillm >ent. >The free self uncovers the ideal and the involved self struggles to give it >substance. Tension builds between the ideal assented to and the outworking >of that ideal in day to day living. Remember Ray's ""Can we have honest love >affairs?"" in motss?? The ideal being in this case 'honest love affairs' as >opposed to what happens often in live itself. (almost metaphysical Ohmigawd !!) (Just for grins Ken I think most of us motss'ers would object to being pigeon holed into Rays world view.. no offence Ray but I know I don't relate to your stuff). This is a very Bold and revealing move on Kens part, he is telling us a lot with this paragraph, and it comes from very deep levels of his psyche... He admits to masturbating, now don't take this lightly many more wordly types cannot make even this small step towards self-understanding. He also tells us that he found masturbation unfulfilling,in the same paragraph we are told why. >In masturbation the self must ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >supply other imaginary selves in seeking a sense of fulfillment with meaning. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >That is if the ideal about sex assented to involves more than just a very basic >physical release from body sexual tension not involving contact with another >self. I know I'll have a protest from Rich Rosen but it seems to me that >masturbation falls short of what sex is about, eh? It is a great pity that so many are unaware that its ok to do something nice and sexual with and for yourself. Kens backhanded comment about how he Loves ALL women EQUALLY (and not really saying how little that is) reveals the anger he feels about having to expend his love on them instead of being able to keep it for himself. >Well, I feel the same way about homosexuality as I do about masturbation. It >falls short of what sex is all about. Here is a very interesting statement, since Ken has already admitted to being a masturbator (at least some time in his life) and is stating here that he feels the same way about homosexuality as masturbation Can we have a pause to wonder if Ken is making this judgement based on personal experience. After all he is saying ""It falls short of what sex is all about"" this sure sounds like a firm belief based on real life experience to me. Interestingly enough it is very common for first sexual experinces to be absolutly dreadfull for most people. I know that my first Adult encounter with Gay sex was so traumatic that its a wonder that I ever tried it a second time! >Well, I feel the same way about homosexuality as I do about masturbation. It >falls short of what sex is all about. To the extent that the homosexuals make >it my business by touting an 'alternative lifestyle' with 'rights'.I oppose >what I view as their lack of understanding of what sex is all about. I think >that they are actually anti-sex!!!! Self destructive sexual behavior is what >they are actually doing. AAHHHHHH now we are getting rightin there to the root of Kens festering painfull feelings.. First of all ""the Homosexuals"" have forced Ken to spend so much time and emotional energy preaching to these filthy buggerers because they ""tout"" an alternative lifestyle and even insist on being given basic human rights Ken almost see's daylight when he admits that what he is in opposition to is merely his VIEW of Gay peoples lack of understanding about ""what sex is all about"", and and that he THINKS we are are actually anti-sex. (Better watch out Ken these are weaknesses that I'm sure the I.C. chaplain will find disturbing) But of course he redeems himself by flatly proclaiming our sexual behaviour as self-destructive. >I feel sorry for them for their loss of sexuality >and while they themselves are not really funny their pretensions to being >an expression of human sexuality that has fulfillment for either a man or >a woman IS funny. They can never have anything more than two members of the >same sex masturbating each other - just another pair of hands! That ole >biological problem for the man of WHERE do you put it, and for the woman >WHAT do you put in it? Or are we just left with fanning it? NO...NO ... don't tell me that I don't know wether to cry or laugh Ken! Just another pair of hands... !!! my my my... Well let me 'splain it to you Ken.... In the first place some people like mutual masturbation, in fact some people like it to the exclusion of just about anything else.And when the participants al have the same (or at least similar) equipment there is hardly a limit of two individuals. As to having a problem about where to put ""it"" (I will assume that you mean your penis) I don't know what barns you hang out behind, but where I grew up ....NOBODY... ever had any trouble finding a good place to put ""it"". >I see an analogy here between homosexual pretensions to human sexual fulfullment >and someone who insists on forcing food up his rectum and trying to vomit it >out. We ain't MADE that way!! AND FOR ME TO SAY SO IS 'HATE', ETC, ETC. >Sure. NO... Ken ... its not really hate.. its presumptuous.... the WAY you say it is hatefull, and often cruel. Your analogy is seriously flawed right up front because you call Gay sex a pretension to human sexual fulfillment, this is a matter that is necesarily the domain of the individual. It is not your place to judge whether anyone else is fulfilled or not, no matter what you may personally think of the behavior in question. I recognise that there are many individuals who do not find same sex partnerships to be sexually fulfilling, but your protestations not withstanding Ken, there are some individuals who do. And thats a FACT.............. >Now I don't propose to see that everyone wears big mittens to bed or that >sodomy laws be strictly enforced in private lives.

Here we go again.. PERVERSION......... gasp........... I will try to refrain from any more comedy .... The simple facts are Ken, that throughout the natural world, sex between motss is common, and NATURAL...(read my lips real slow now) That means it happens ALL the TIME.. with no help from the Devil or anything. >And then there's AIDS.

The aids virus can be passed by good ole missionary position, fuck me hard you bastard, heterosexual .......... intercourse... and those who do not heed the current information about safe sex (motss and motos both) may not live to regret it.

Well here we are at the end (pardon the pun) of a long (did you call it slippery, ahhhhhhhhhh) road, and my hunch is rewarded with the admission (emission) I've been waiting for... ""They are people just like me""... we know Ken we Know.. some of us have been just as bitter before we gave up the fight. And no you don't have to assent to anyones beliefs Ken, thats what makes America great... Since you've asked why we protest at what you've said after you call us pretentious perverts,flagrant touters of death dealing un-natural sexual self gratification,comedic perpetrators of self destructive immoral anti-sex, mutually masturbating merchants of loneliness, and worst, I'll tell you. Its because you stick your ill-informed bigotted nonsense out where every body can see how silly it is, and you have been unnecesarilly cruel and persistent in your terrorism (there I said it again) of this newsgroup. You know that you come here to motss in order to stir up shit ;-) you enjoy the attention, we aren't fooled by your claims of an evangelical mission to save our worthless and unfulfilled lives. Besides this isn't a protest over what you say , this is an opportunity to squarely face the kind of bigotry and fearfull anger breeding homophobia that every Gay person has had to deal with every day of their lives. >I could go on as to why I think one certain woman is the ideal but this is >too long already.

I trust your information, but I'd like to know why this point doesn't matter. Also, what is your information on cunnilingus? I don't think you mentioned it in your article. Thanks for a reasoned posting. The ""semen that `leaks out' before climax"" is an emission from the Cowper's gland. Noone really knows right now if this emission can transmit HTLVIII virus, so it is best to avoid exposing any mucuous membranes to it. In other words, if you engage in the POSSIBLY SAFE activity of fellatio (cock-sucking), you decrease risk by avoiding any emissions from the penis, including ""pre-cum."" Lick *around* the ""head"" of the penis, down its length, and down by the balls (scrotum), rather than putting it all in your mouth. To further decrease risk, gargle with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9 (try a few to see which tastes best), or use a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution (say 1 part of 3% hydrogen peroxide : 3-5 parts water -- but don't let it sit around for more than a few hours). Most detergents kill the HTLVIII virus, especially in combination with hot water. Even safer, of course, is to develop a liking for condoms, and licking the condom, rather than the penis directly. As far as cunnilingus, that appeared in the original information as another POSSIBLY SAFE activity (oral-vaginal sex with spermicide, i.e. nonoxynol-9 or equivalent).

There are lots of agents which inactivate viruses in vitro, but which turn out to be ineffective or deleterious when used in vivo. I am repeating myself here (I addressed this several months ago) but Will's recommendations require this: There is no evidence that nonoxynol-9 spermicides or lubricants have any effect on the spread of HTLV-3 infection. Ditto for peroxide. Nonoxynol-9 is a detergent, and for all we know, it might facilitate its spread through some strange surface-active effect on mucous membranes. Peroxide is immediately broken down by catalase, ubiquitous in the body, and it's a weak antiseptic agent by any standards. The point is, we just don't know the effects of these (or any other) agents as prophylactic measures against infection, and it is downright irresponsible to give the impression that there is anything but uneducated guessing behind it. Better to not be exposed at all, by the use of condoms, TRUE safe-sex practices where there is no chance of exchanging fluids, or abstinence. -- /Steve Dyer {harvard,seismo}!bbnccv!bbncc5!sdyer sd...@bbncc5.ARPA",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/5cgl9ZU_E2g/m/wyY9gjPoleUJ,,,

Possibly, but nearly every pleasure involves some sort of risk. Everyone who eats raw oysters runs some risk of being poisoned, and everyone who likes driving at 100 on the Mass Pike runs some risk of crashing.

It was about a week or two ago, but I kept forgetting to post it, and no one has mentioned it yet, so here goes: Koch shuts gay sex bar in AIDS fight ==================================== Reuter ------ NEW YORK City lawyers won court approval just after dawn yesterday to shut a homosexual ""leather"" bar in a highly publicized anti-AIDS campaign. But even as authorities tacked a cardboard ""Closed"" sign on the door of the Mineshaft bar in the city's rundown meat-packing district, customers vowed to continue their sado-masochistic sex practices. ""It's a bad joke. Dozens of private sex clubs will open within a month and the police will never find them,"" said John Svennson, 38, a caterer. Mayor Edward Koch had announced the crackdown on the Mineshaft and other gay sex bars and bathhouses yesterday only hours after winning election to a third term. ""What we are saying is you can't sell death (!) in our city and get away with it,"" said Mr Koch, whose announcement appeared to catch city lawyers by surprise. After a day-long scramble, the lawyers failed to get to court by closing time. Owners on the Mineshaft, anticipating the city's move, did not open the bar Wednesday night. Two weeks ago state officials, expressing alarm over more than 7,000 AIDS deaths in New York City, set new rules empowering local authorities to shut gathering places for ""high risk sex"" such as anal and oral intercourse. Though the city did not need approval for the Mineshaft closing, city hall sources said the mayor decided to use the courts rather than police action to head off a possible protest. Pretty strange, wouldn't you say? It's the ole double-standard again: straight bars are not disease centres, but gay bars are. I bet that a higher fraction of the straight clientele of a straight bar has herpes than the fraction of the gay clientele of a gay bar has aids. But anyway... the other thing that really angered me about this article is that they seem to be saying that the PURPOSE of (gay) sex is to transmit aids. As if that's what we're trying to do. And of course there's also the assumption that straight people never have anal intercourse, which is quite established to be false. Actually, this article also assumes that straight people don't have oral intercourse.

Um, I'm holding off on any opinion of the Mineshaft closing right now, but the Mineshaft wasn't your ""typical"" gay bar where you might go for a beer to meet your friends--it was a pretty raunchy sex club where unsafe sex practices remained commonplace even up until its closing. It *does* boggle my mind to imagine the mindset of the people who continued to have sex there. Although it is always hard to separate politics from practice in a situation of this kind, I am inclined to think that this closure wasn't so much anti-gay as anti-unsafe-sex, especially given the observed intransigence of the owners in encouraging the use of condoms and safe sex practices.

Taylor, Ph.D., Ed.D. Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, San Francisco, CA, 415-928-1133 Call them for a copy of their report ""Condom Use, AIDS Prevention, and Increased Sexual Enjoyment"" If you live in the San Francisco area, call for a reservation to one of their workshops on ""Eroticizing Safe Sex"" (Excellent!) Another good source is the SF AIDS Foundation Hotline, 800-FOR-AIDS] Nonoxynol-9 is a mild detergent used in spermicides and various other ""feminine hygiene"" products to prevent pregnancy and V.D. It works by bursting the outer protein cap of sperm and various disease organisms. In laboratory tests, this detergent quickly and effectively kills herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis, CMV, yeast, trichomonas, and amoebas. Most recently, it also has been found to kill AIDS virus easily in the test tube. This is promising news, however nonoxynol-9 is considerably more effective under laboratory conditions than in actual sexual use because: a.) The inert ingredients in spermicides -- foams, gels, and creams -- do not always spread evenly or form a sufficient chemical barrier for nonoxynol-9 to kill pathogens before they can reach uninfected tissue. b.) People often use spermicides incorrectly and only when they ""think"" a partner is infected. c.) People abandon condoms instead of using nonoxynol-9 and condoms together. It is very tempting to use nonoxynol-9 as a layer of prevention against AIDS while engaging in oral sex and anal intercourse. But make sure spermicides don't irritate your skin, your mouth, or your rectum. When in doubt, check with your doctor. And to be sure the doctor's really up on the subject, be well informed yourself. (See ""Reading Up On Condoms and Spermicides."") Studies show that: 1. Nonoxynol-9 has had a very good safety record for 35 years and has been used by Gays in spermicides and a couple of lubricants for anal intercourse over the last 7 years without any reports of problems. A preliminary study by Bruce Voeller, Ph.D indicates that the intestines of 50 spermicide anal users were healthy. Animal research which studied nonoxynol-9 excretion through the intestines also showed no abnormalities. However, spermicides have only been tested for safe human use on the skin or in the vagina. The FDA noted in 1980 that spermicides are regularly swollowed during oral sex. Because of their extremely low toxicity and because nonoxynol-9 is used as a wetting agent in foods, the FDA deemed spermicides safe when eaten in small quantities. 2. Spermicides provide very important protection from common STD transmission if used properly and every time a person has intercourse (remember, the testing on spermicides and AIDS s incomplete). However, the effectiveness drops quickly from 90%+ to 70% or less effectiveness when not used exactly as instructed on the label. 3. Spermicides and condoms used together and correctly result in much greater disease prevention than either technique alone. 4. At this point not enough is known about the effect of nonoxynol-9 on human intestines (especially during sex) or about AIDS virus to recommend spermicides totally without reservation for anal sex OR to recommend strongly against them! But they are certainly recommended for vaginal intercourse as a layer of AIDS prevention (provided a person is not allergic to them -- remember that changing brands usually takes care of this problem).",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/qTwX0OE7Ji4/m/9pLhaEH0yzAJ,,,

I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program to not only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (with total and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence and spread of the disease. There is a State Health Department Hotline (1-800-462-1884), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS. Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by the N.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for persons who wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus. Testing is free of charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained through the use of a code system. Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody test need not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information. N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and other community service organizations that provide educational and outreach services associated with AIDS. In addition, N.Y.S. presently allocates annually more funding for AIDS research than for any other specific disease except cancer. jr {allegra,seismo}!rochester!ritcv!jrc",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/zTIyZZtv2fA/m/9e9ZcPNxZX4J,,,

These practicescarry high risk:- FellatioThe swallowing of semen, which can contain the HTLV-III virus,is considered a high risk.- Vaginal intercourse (as stated in the original posting)- Analingus (Oral contact with the rectum)- ""Fisting""- Anal Intercourse (whether homosexual or heterosexual)(Included in the ""100 Questions and Answers,"" 'Some cases of AIDShave been transmitted from an infected male to a female, and it isnot known to what extent anal intercourse was involved.')I would like to add that the State of New York has a multi-faceted program tonot only identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus (withtotal and complete anonymity assured), but to reduce the incidence andspread of the disease. There is a State Health Department Hotline(1-800-462-1884), which provides up-to-date information about AIDS.Eight regional HTLV-III antibody test sites have been established by theN.Y.S. Health Department to provide testing and counseling for personswho wish to know if they have been exposed to the virus. Testing is freeof charge at these sites, and strict confidentiality is maintained throughthe use of a code system. Persons seeking the the HTLV-III antibody testneed not give a name, address, or any other potentially identifying information.N.Y.S. is spending $1.6 million annually to fund regional task forces and othercommunity service organizations that provide educational and outreach servicesassociated with AIDS.

I was completely surpised by my reactions, and I thought I'd share it with other readers. A few weeks ago, a close friend called to invite my lover and I to a dinner party on New Year's Eve being given by a couple who were friends of his. We had met one of them once before at a party a few years ago, and he asked our friend to call us and invite us for their New Year celebration. The night before the dinner, we called our friend to get directions and details, and before hanging up, he said non-chalantly that they also have a third person living with them who has AIDS. We finished getting the particulars and hung up, not missing a beat. What was most remarkable was my reaction (which also turned out to be my lover's reaction, although we didn't talk about it until after the dinner.) First, though it may surprise some of you, not every gay person has AIDS or knows someone with it or knew someone who died of it. I think that for the great majority of gay men, and that included myself, AIDS is an enormous abstraction, always on the verge of becoming a physical threat, but mostly elusive and immaterial, like an enemy whom you haven't seen and who hasn't yet attacked. I had never met anyone I knew to have AIDS, though friends had. Nevertheless, most of us are schooled in the ""proper"" reactions to have, and it's rather frightening when our experience doesn't bear them out. I was appalled at myself. I had three reactions. First, anger and disappointment at having to spend a supposedly festive holiday with someone whose condition was anything but, and not knowing how to share social smalltalk with eventual death looking you in the face, and second, REAL anger at my friend who waited to tell us about this third person's condition the night before dinner, making impossible any superficially honorable excuse from the obligation. Finally, and just as surprising, a real irrational aversion to being in the company of someone with the disease, knowing intellectually that it can't be caught by sitting across the dinner table, but even that offering little solace. Luckily, I could see how bankrupt all these were, and we went ahead, just a little fearful of how the evening would turn out. As expected, confronting these fears makes them disappear, for we had a enjoyable time, but rather sad and poignant too, for the person with AIDS was obviously tired and weak, and seemed almost to shrink away in the face of social company and chitchat. Life looks almost normal until you see the oxygen tank in the john, and he was cold all the time, wearing a down vest indoors and a quilt on his legs. But he kept up his own before and during dinner, too, before he excused himself to go to bed before the new year came in. And you begin to see that, for any people with terminal debilitating diseases, life consists of trying to keep as much of the daily routine as one can accomodate.

Did> they try and feed you those hot Italian peppers, get you braces, bribe the> baby sitter???Fact: when I was a child, being brought up by two happily marriedheterosexual parents, I was told there was nothing wrongwith being gay. I never questioned that, and I still don't.Fact: my father's best friend, a man I grew to deeply love and respect,was gay. He never once tried to pick me up, counsel me into beinggay, or anything else of the like. He recently died of AIDS atage 49.Fact: a regular babysitter for me and my syblings was a lesbian. She,too, never tried to influence me or my sister or my two brothersinto being gay. In fact, it was not until recently that I learnedshe was a lesbian (I'm 23). She, too, grew very close to meand my family.Fact: I am and continue to be heterosexual. So are the rest of my syblings.In other words, environments permissive toward homosexuality do notnecessarily encourage it. I have never felt any need to be gay,nor am I likely to. Do not worry about your son. Encouraging""masculine"" behavior as described above is likely to do a lot moreharm than good. This is a great opportunity for you to tell himabout the difference between sexes -- it's a good lesson for him(I am assuming he is quite young by your references to the cartoons).I don't know what ""keep chargin'"" means, but I return to you thesame greeting.______________________________Jim Campbell{decvax ! cca | yale | ihnp4 | cbosgd}!ima!jimc{bbncca | harvard | zurton | cfib | mit-ems | wjh12 }!ima!jimc{uscvax | ucla-vax | vortex}!ism780!jimcINTERACTIVE Systems, 7th floor, 441 Stuart St, Boston, MA 02116; 617-247-1155",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/faxIR5LV48g/m/BtnU-JgLgf4J,,,

Personally, I'vedated men (until I met my mate) and feel it is the best and most logical wayto proceed in a relationship that might take a romantic direction. I reallynever got a bad reaction from anybody, but I think Sacramento is more orientedto that type of thing than larger, more highly populated areas (I just movedto Pittsburgh; I'm not from here).In answer to the first question, I don't think anybody should have to apologiseif they wish to date. For that matter, why should anybody apologise for how he(or she) runs his social life as long as he doesn't hurt anybody else?Especially if the constraints are upon oneself. I found a lot of people used tomake me feel guilty about not going to bed with them. Then I realised, what thehell should I feel guilty about that for? They don't need me for that, and Ihave no obligation to them in that regard. So I did what I thought was right,and if they didn't like it, tough. That was their problem, not mine. But thosewho were truely my friends remained so. And it's only silly if you choose itto be so.As far as when an intimate relationship should begin, I would say it dependsupon the two individuals involved, and what your goals are. There isnothing wrong with discussing the issue; it can save a whole lot of confusion.Discuss your feelings, how you feel about each other. Nothing is 100% certain,after all. When you both feel the time is really right (based on more thanhorneyness) then it undoubtedly will be.I'm glad this was brought up. For a while, I thought I was the only one whothought dating was a good idea. I used to hear all this junk about how onlyheterosexuals date and we can't/shouldn't do what they do. I think that'sbull.

I think youmeant the latter.My advice is that you have to learn from experience whatis right for you. I know that for myself, there has to be a physical attractionfrom the start as well as a non-physical interest in the person. If there isinsufficient non-physical interest, nothing will develop after we have sex,and after the sex is no longer ""mysterious"" with him, my interest in seeing himwill decrease rapidly. If there is insufficient physical attraction, I willquickly become disinterested in the sex, and the relationship with end unlesshe is interesting enough non-physically to be a ""platonic"" friend.The only point at which TIMING of the first sex is important is that thereis enough interaction beforehand that I get to know if/how he isnon-physically interesting to me. This is important because this interestis necessary for me to sustain romantic feelings just in case the sex windsup just so-so.I know that since the onset of the AIDS epidemic, I have been more interestedin ""dating"" with the goal of ""settling down"" with someone. However, speakinghealth-wise, sex in the context of a ""relationship"" is no safer than""recreational"" sex unless the two of you have had sex with no one else inthe past five or so years.",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/j-Nis-M1Ymc/m/kXT4-cARIZsJ,,,

The New York Native printed a UPI wire service article recently which quoted a British urinary and venereal disease expert, John Seale, on this topic. He said that, since 1949, biological warfare research centers knew about the highly lethal Visna virus in sheep. The virus grew easily in cell cultures, had a structure remarkably similar to the AIDS virus, and caused a similar disease. The AIDS virus has one gene extra over the Visna virus, but, says Seale, ""inserting an extra gene into a virus is a routine procedure in modern genetic engin- eering"". He went on to say that it was likely that the potential of developing the Visna virus for use in biological warfare was considered by research establishments both in the East and the West, though ""it would have been a very odd one for the West to make because it is so slow to develop"". The idea that the AIDS virus had been manipulated in the laboratory by biological scientists merited ""serious consideration"", he said. -- rod williams | {ihnp4,dual}!ptsfa!ptsfc!rjw ------------------------------------------- pacific bell | san ramon | california",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/S1_Tef5EQJA/m/XNNsdElgWncJ,,,

An admission chest X-ray reveals is diffusely cloudy on both sides,> suggesting interstitial pneumonia. Routine blood test shows mild anemia (low> hematocrit) and a White Blood Cell count in the low normal range.>> What is the suspect diagnosis?Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediatedImmune Suppression. (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrumantibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptionaldirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.)Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronicdisease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases.The white blood cell count is in the normal range. But given aPneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated. So, seeing it in the normalrange is akin to seeing it depressed. This is in agreement with the findingsof oral thrush.What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression:Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses(iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenaltumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or inPituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing thehormone ACTH. Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but theimmune suppression is rarely quite this severe.Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell)and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease). In a young woman,Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the mostcommonly encountered Cancers.In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possibletumors. Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities,(What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history.The Pneumonia:Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal.Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and itcauses the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visibleas white on X-ray.Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, althoughmay cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization isnecessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome).Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily toTB. It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, butbecause the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to beginwith.A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, oreven miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country)As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organismPneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressedpatients.THE DIAGNOSIS:Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii)Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significantneedle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadonemaintenance. Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group.Confirming the Diagnosis:#1 A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed aninverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbersExplanation: T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cellsand Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able totease them apart) The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) LessHelper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens inmany illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated.#2 An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on thepatient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3.I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me thatthey had those symptoms. It was an abbreviated description, and I don'twant them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS.""Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into theworkings of the medical model.[Feedback, anyone?]--Craig Werner!philabs!aecom!werner""...if that's the hand you use, well, nevermind...""",https://groups.google.com/g/net.med/c/akgubYYgb4o/m/vP80yh_0FvMJ,,,

It maybe the hundredth time you've said it, but it's the first time they'veheard it, so make sure you sound like you mean it. The hundredth timeis just as important as the first.""He was right.Three weeks and 15 cities later, I had summoned up the same answers sooften that I felt like a cross between Dr. Ruth Westheimer and theaudio-animatronics Abe Lincoln at DisneyLand. Most of the questionswere about my books (""When will Mouse find a lover?"" and ""Didn't youkill Connie twice?"" were two of the biggies), but a surprising numberof them cast me in the role of Coming-Out Consultant, a keeper of themysteries of Happy Homohood.Remembering Tim's suggestions, I surveyed my most frequent responsesand discovered the following blueprint for a more fulfilling life.Read it once, and I promise I won't bring it up again.----------------------------------------------------------------------1. Stop Begging for Acceptance----------------------------------------------------------------------Homosexuality is still an anathema to most people in thiscountry---even to many homosexuals. If you camp out on the doorstepof society waiting for ""the climate"" to change, you'll be there untilJoan Rivers registers Democratic.Your job is to accept yourself---joyfully and with no apologies--andget on with the adventure of your life.----------------------------------------------------------------------2. Don't Run Away from Straight People.----------------------------------------------------------------------They need variety in their lives just as much as you do, and you'llforfeit the heady experience of feeling exotic if you limit yourselfto the company of your own kind.Furthermore, you have plenty to teach your straight friends abouttolerance and humor and the comfortable enjoyment of their ownsexuality. (Judging from ""Donahue,"" many of them have only now begun tolearn about foreplay; we, on the other hand, have entire resorts builtaround the practice.)Besides, it's time you stopped thinking of heterosexuals as the enemy.It's both convenient and comforting to bemoan the cardboard villainyof Jerry Falwell and friends, but the real culprits in this melodramaare just as queer as you are.They sleep with you by night and conspire to keep you invisible byday. They are studio-chiefs and bank presidents and talk-show hosts,and they don't give a damn about your oppression because they've gottheir piece of the pie, and they got it by living a lie.----------------------------------------------------------------------3. Refuse to Cooperate in the Lie.----------------------------------------------------------------------It is not your responsibility to ""be discreet"" for the sake of peoplewho are still ashamed of their own natures. And don't tell me about""job security."" Nobody's job will ever be safe until the generalpublic is permitted to recognize the full scope of our homosexualpopulation.Does that include teachers?You bet it does. Have you forgotten already how much it hurt to be 14and gay and scared to death of it? Doesn't it gall you just a littlethat your ""discreet"" lesbian social-studies teacher went home everyday to her lover and her cats and her Ann Bannon novels without oncegiving you even a clue that there was hope for your own future?What earthly good is your discretion, when teen-agers are still beingmurdered for the crime of effeminacy?I know, I know---you have a right to keep your private life private.Well, you do that, my friend--but don't expect the world not to noticewhat you're really saying about yourself. And the rest of us.Lighten up, Lucille. There's help on the way.----------------------------------------------------------------------4. Stir Up Some Shit Now and Again.----------------------------------------------------------------------Last spring I wrote a commentary for the ""Los Angeles Times"" on thesubject of television's shoddy treatment of homosexuality. The pieceoriginally contained a sentence to the effect that ""it's high time thepublic found out there are just as many homosexuals who resembleRichard Chamberlain as there are who resemble Richard Simmons.""The editor cut it. When I asked him why, he said: ""Because it'slibelous, that's why.""To which I replied: ""In the first place, I'm not saying that RichardChamberlain is gay; I'm simply saying there are plenty of gay men whoresemble him. In the second place, even if I were saying that RichardChamberlain is gay, it wouldn't be a libelous remark, because I'm gaymyself and I don't say those things with malice. I don't *accuse*anyone of being gay; I state it as a matter of fact or opinion.""Three years earlier, I confronted a similar problem with an editor atthe ""New York Times"" who forbade me to make reference in an essay to""gay film writer Vito Russo"" without some written proof from Vito---anaffidavit, no less---that he was in fact, one of *those*.I asked the editor if the ""Times"" took similar precautions whenmention was made of black or Jewish people. Surely there are plentyof Americans who would hate to be mistaken for black or Jewish, so whyisn't their bigotry protected by the strong arm of the newspaper libellaw?""Because,"" said the editor, ""it's just not the same thing.""And they're doing their damnest to keep it that way. When the newcity of West Hollywood assembled its council last month, theAssociated Press identified the three openly gay members as ""admittedhomosexuals."" Admitted, get it? Fifteen years after the StonewallRebellion, the wire service wants to make it perfectly clear thathomosexuality is still a dirty little secret that requires fullconfession before it can be mentioned at all.If you don't raise some hell, that isn't going to change.----------------------------------------------------------------------5.

I got quite a few responses to the ""It Ain't Pretty"" posting, what was surprising was that all of the respondants concurred with my article and admitted to having same feelings. This is interesting since in person many may have changed the subject or told me to stick it in my ear. This could be in part to the semi anonymity that a computer link affords. Many are more willing to share inner feelings to a total stranger then to their closest friends. This is almost like an electronic confessional in a way with the priest seated behind a terminal on one coast and the confessor on the opposite coast. Last year a gay man sent me personal mail to say he enjoyed the Jason postings. He went on at length to tell me he had contracted AIDS and shared all of his personal fears and hopes for the future. He was a read only subscriber who has long since left the network. I carried on a dialogue with him until he told me he was too sick to continue working and bid me goodbye. I was glad at least that he had the love and support of his employer, family and friends from what he told me. But! the total purpose of this newsgroup is not *just* for emotional and spiritual cath- arsis; I've enjoyed may articles written by others on subjects ranging from Gay Parenting, What people do over the holidays, AIDS research, Gay music, gay this and gay that. Through pen/keyboard pals I've learned what gay life is like in other countries as well as other parts of the United States. Many non gay readers have sent me mail saying that life on the single heterosexual side of the tracks is no different then on our side. This has been (for me) a forum of understanding (Arndtism aside) and I hope it continues to be so in the future. Even Ken may be looking for answers, although in an unorthadox manner. None of us can read the other poster's minds, only what we see on our screens. Well! before I diverge from the subject any further, let me get back on track....lemmee see, where was I? As I said before, many have shared (in priv- ate) feelings that I have put before the group. I'm not looking for cheap psychotherapy but since my minor in college was ""Psych"" I've always had a keen interest in what makes people tick and have observed various behaviors pretty closely. What I've come up with is that most of us act fairly rational in our everyday lives; when it comes to matters of the heart then many of us go a little squirrely, behave irratioanlly, etc. I had mentioned that I'm much more warmly received in heterosexual groups than in gay ones even though most of these people know that I'm gay. Maybe because I act masculine and have *butch* hobbies they consider me one of the guys, maybe they're just a bunch of well adjusted heterosexuals who feel sec- ure in themselves enough to know I'm not a threat. Straight people on the whole tend to be less insecure than we are. Sure! why not! they are the status quo and don't have as much to worry about as far as being accepted goes. I have seen some of the most disgustingly ugly fat straight men who had very positive images of themselves,""I'm a good looking dude!"" that were popular and made out with the women like a Tomcat in heat. I've also seen some of the most incredibly great looking gay men who felt they weren't worthy of ever hoping to be liked, let alone loved! When ""Small Town Boy"" by Bronski Beat came out I could identify with the lyrics, ""Pushed around and kicked around, always the lonely boy"" I allowed the hatred of my peers to become my own self hatred. When I looked in the mirror I saw an awfully ugly person as years went by. After coming out I expected acceptance but found out that gays can be just as rejecting of their own as the homophobes are of them; I felt even uglier. I'm just now learning to go easier on myself and say, ""you're not a bad looking person at all and talented to boot, despite what they think"". The insecurity in gay men can come across as jealousy of others, resulting in attitude and catty behavior to the object of their envy. Of course you'll never know that hte other person wishes he was you or had your traits. He may dish or in other ways discount you as a person in front of others. In this way he can attract more attention to himself. One thing I have learned about gay social groups/circles is that there is already an unspoken pecking order. There may be an inner circle of kingpins who bask in attention. Now I or some new comer show up and the fun begins. They may take an instant liking to me or rej- ect my presence. If they see that I don't pose a threat to the status quo or that I would compliment/enhance their attractiveness, then I may be asked to join in. On the other hand if I seem to be overly attractive in their eyes and they feel that I may steal some of their fire, they will ignore/reject the fact that I'm there. They may even circulate through the crowd whispering subtle warnings about me to their friends. This will help assure that no one actually finds out that I could be in fact, a very nice person. Let me give you a couple of true, real life experiences I've had. I'll bet many of you have been on both ends of these scenarios. I used to hang out at a local gay bar until I learned how the clientel acted. The place attaracted the same basic crowd every week with a few out of towners passing through on weekends. Most of the regulars knew each other so gossip was common. All of a sudden I was aware that I wasn't welcome; the doorman started hassling me, I had a hard time getting served and when I walk- ed through the bar it was like Moses parting the Red Sea as the crowd moved aside and stared as I passed. After a while I got quite concerned and since I was kinda friendly with the manager I asked to chat with him in private. We got together after closing time and I voiced my concerns. He asked me if I was into kinky sex to which I said no and questioned why he was asking this. I found out a heavy rumor had started that I was into heavy S & M and had a torture chamber in my apartment. I also suppposedly had sent a couple of guys to th hospital. The manager asked me to be honest, ""do you have AIDS?"" geeeze no wonder people were running away, I had become an AIDS infected dungeon master! I got furious at hearing this and asked who started the rumor!! He said to the best of his knowledge there were a few guys who thought I was a real hunk and wanted to go to bed with me. Since I had never noticed anyone eyeing me and took action on it, they interptreted this as a rejection. The rational of their act- ions was, ""well he's too stuck up to talk with me. Well I'll fix him! If I can't have him then no one else will either!"" This is one of the most vicious things some jaded queen can ever pull on another person and it's quite common among a lot of gay circles...petty jealousy turned into hatred. I never found out who the people were that started the rumors, just as well since I may have started indulging in heavy S & M with a certain few men. In another case I had been invited to attend a new gay social group's meet- ing. Right from the start I fit right in and felt welcome. A lot of the members said that they thought I was a welcome change and addition to the group. I beg- an chairing a few meetings, then something went wrong, everyone started pulling away. I was left in the corner all of a sudden and again started wondering what was happening. I found out that the founder of the group, who's house we met at had started some ugly rumors about me.....why? One night I dropped in on him and of course he had nothing to say, wanted me to leave. I took him by the shoulders and pushed him up against the wall, demanding to know what his problem was, then I'de leave. He broke down crying and said that he was afraid I was go- ing to become the center of attention, that everyone liked me and a few wanted to sleep with me. The guy was a real hunk and had enjoyed the limelight until now. He also said that he wanted to go to bed with me which I found flattering. I asked why he just didn't come out and talk with me directly. His reply was that he didn't want to get rejected. this one eneded up happier; I spent the night with him and had a wonderful time. The two of us agreed that we would co- chair the next meeting on Jealousy and childish gay insecurities and how they destroy our solidarity. He and I went on to become friends as well as fuck bud- dies until he moved to L.A. The last case is a very close friend who I'm just beginning to understand after 7 years. Ever since we became close he would compete with me on every sub- ject we discussed. If I said I had a nice dinner, he had one that was 10 times better, If I met a hot guy and slept with him, I wouldn't get the first sentence out and he's be telling me how he almost scored with a perfect 10! He asked to see my Jason articles and said that no one would be interested in reading them, he could do better. The funny thing is that this poor guy hasn't really accom- plished anything spectacular in his life. He's a wonderful guy but one of the most insecure people I know. Everything I did became a challenge to him; what was even worse at the time was that I discovered he was in love with me and felt because I didn't acknowledge and act on his erotic attraction that I was now an opponent on the erotic field of competition. At times he would admit to being envious of things I had done, the men I had dated and my looks/body. I have often told him, ""you have to be happy with yourself, you're a good person. You can't be me and probably wouldn't want to if you were."" To this day he still carries on in rut of inertia, still competes in his own mind. I can't stop him, only he can become self confident enough so that we compliment one another and are not in a constant state of petty competition. I wish there were more gay men like my last roomate; a self confident, friendly person who has no time for petty gay games. The two of us never competed or felt the need to gos- sip behind one another's backs. We were both open in introducing each other to our friends. I know there are many other well adjusted, self confident, polite and openly friendly gays out there, but so far they have eluded my field of vision. I was raised a Catholic and a Christian. As a boy I never understood the reasoning behind many actions that we bill as ""sins"". I just knew that for some reason jealously, covetous behavior, lieing, gossiping and all the catty stuff a lot of people wallow in was a no no in God's eyes. I think I have a better understanding now, not just because God doesn't approve but because it drasticly reduces our ability to interact as brothers and sisters down here on the planet. We must rise above the petty bickering as gay people, lest we all drown in our own shit. In my earlier posting I mentioned speaking to a couple of straight Black friends. Blacks have suffered a common oppression, if they spent all their time leaving one another out because so and so was too black or someone was afriad that someone else might become too popular, there might not have been a Martin Luthor King Jr, there might not be Blacks in management positions or blacks in government, etc, etc. They share a common bond of racial heritage as well as a history of pain and discrimination. The building I work in has many Black employees. What I notice is that whoever they are, they are always friendly to one another, greeting, smiling and chatting as they pass; even to s newcomer. This is not just at work since I have been the only white at black house parties and social functions. There was warmth and acceptance, even to me who felt out of place but was encouraged to fit right in. On the other hand we as gay men and women are not a bonefide ""minority"" therefore not taken seriously. I have yet to apply for a job where a question on the application (right there with race, creed, nationality) is sexual pref- erance: Check one | | Straight | | Bisexual | | Gay | | Other please state. We have no real reason to stick together other than our common oppression and the fact that we make love withsame sexed members. Richard Pryor made a state- ment on stage that gay liberation was the right to suck cock! I'll tell you, if I were heterosexual that's what I'de think on the surface! To me I'de like it to be more; not having to fear physical harm for being gay, not fearing loss of job or apartment, being shown the same respect as any other tax paying Amer- icans and being able to point to the crowd marching down the street on Gay Pride day proclaiming, ""These are my brothers and sisters, all united"". Of course someone may shout out of the crowd, ""you're not my brother or friend, go away I heard you're bad news"". Well, actually one guy may whisper to another, ""ppssst see the guy with the video camera, stay away from him, I hear he fucks dogs and cats"". This of course is as it stands now. Lookism is a real problem in our community and a major contributor to the in/out crowd syndrome. Now be honest kids, how many of you have been at a bar or party and this much older, not very attractive person stands next to you; does- n't say or do anything, just stands there and you all of a sudden decide to move I'll bet you didn't feel comfortable around him because you were afraid someone may think he's with you. How many times have you been chatting with someone you may not find attractive and all of a sudden a friend walks in, you turn and totally disregard the person you've been talking to; afraid of what your friend might say about your choice of company. Aw c'mon I know a lot of you, especially you young whippah snappahs can identify with this. Well! it's just not polite, they're just as gay as you and deserve the same recognition as you get. You may be old and not so pretty some day. Remember what hte Bible says, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". What this boils down to is don't trash oth- ers unless you're a masochist and enjoy it yourself. If being snubbed hurts your feelings don't pass it on to the next guy. The bitchiness buck keeps getting passed on and on and on in the gay world and there's no excuse for it. Stop and think about it for a while, someone gets hurt and you may look like a little shining, slightly tarnished star. Your friends may approve but deep down I'll bet they don't trust you and would not think twice of trashing you. Along thee lines of ""Do unto others"" is the prejudgment of a new face. Ok you see a wonderously handsome guy wno you want to get to know, you fromulate your witty introduction while wiping your sweaty palms on your jeans, then decide, what the hell! why bother! he probably a snob and a jerk! You walk away always holding on to the opinion that Mr Hunk is a jerkoff, and you pass this information on to friends. What gets accomplished; you have insulated your- self from the possible hurt of rejection and made yourself look good in your mind's eye, you have passed up the possability of a hot night in bed or at least making a new chum, have polarized others against this person even though you know nothing more than he's gorgeous, you have in subtle ways hurt further gay solidarity as a group and you have passed the bitchiness buck once again. Why not just go up and say ""Hi"" I don't think he'll pull a gun out and shoot you (although from the bulge in his jeans he's carrying some kinda weapon:-) for saying hello. The worst thing that he could do is walk away or say something trite in passing by. What gets hurt....your pride, not gay pride but your own selfish pride. The good looking get ignored, snubbed and gossiped about just as much as the less attractive, better beleive it boys! I dated a guy once who worked as a mod- el for a big agancy in New York. Ya know what, he asked why a good looking guy like me saw anything in him....aw! c'mon gimmee a break. Even though this guy was an absolute 10 (shhhh be still my heat); had a body Naulilus would kill for, the face of an angel, the dicka death and the charisma of a rock star....he felt he was ugly! So here we are walking hand in hand wondering why the other saw any ting in us; needless to say the relationship was short lived. I lter learned that most guys wouldda killed to go out with him but figured they were not wor- thy to bask in his shadow, therefore he was avoided like the plague. What laid beneath the face, muscles and everything else was a very sweet, quiet and shy person who had been labeled as a snob. I've run into many men in non threatening envoronments who actively snubbed me at gay bars and parties. Once they got to chatting with me they admitted to having me figured all wrong. They were under the impression in the bar that because I was muscular and dressed the part of the hot clone, that I was un- approachable, therefore a jerk! What they found in private, away from their friends is that I'm pretty laid back, open, soft spoken and friendly. What we must all do is give each other a chance instead of pronouncing the verdict of ""guilty"" before having all the facts on a person. If the American judicial system worked like the gay social mileiu does, everyone would be in prison, with no hope of parole. I can usually tell fairly easy if a person is a snob and jerk. Their haughty behavior will give them away. If the tall dark stranger is just kinda quiet and alone he's probably just that ""quiet and alone"" with no airs or affectations. I cannot see labeling a guy as arrogant or stuck up, just because he's the lone wolf or outsider, but many do. To put somebody else down or make them feel unwelcome as a way of making ourselves feel better is a cheap shot. Those of you who may do it should stop and think for a while about how secure you feel about yourself. This can be a hard and painful process. You may find out that you don't really have any good friends, that you don't think you're worth knowing yourself, etc. Take a minute to examine the reasons you reject/snub others. What is it about them that you don't like; are you envious of their looks, career, personality or anything else? If you are, then stop right there before attempting to sabotage their success in a situation. What's at stake; your pride, your own shaky position on the social totem pole, your likability, etc? Do some emotional houseclean- ing on yourself before you attack someone else. As thge Bible also says, ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone"". This is a very hard thing to do without some serious thinking on your own part. Ok everybody....drop the rocks! Before closing I'de like to talk briefly about why gay men seem to surround themselves (especially the younger ones) with guys who they feel will make them look good. Beauty is only skin deep but it sure turns a lotta heads. Underneath we're all made of the same blood, guts and bones that psycho horror flicks enjoy splattering on the screen....not very pretty at all...yech! We all posess an immortal soul (which some would sell for some looks) and a common humanity. We also share our gayness and sensitivity. Gays are among some of the most sensit- ive, empathetic and polite people in human services. As waiters, health workers and other public servants they are the friendliest. So! why not treat your gay brothers even better, regardless of their looks or what others have told you. A gay hairdresser may treat an ugly old bag lady with more respect then some- one he's introduced to who's nose may not be the right shape. I chose my few friends on content and character, not on slick packaging. Many guys are able to get by on looks alone and lack any social etiquette whatsoever. They are the ones who will surround themselves with an entourage of pretty men who are as shallow as themselves. I'm not generalizing, I've just seen it too many times to write it off as a delusion. Needless to say I'm not involved with the beautiful who's looks will pass. I'm dieing to see what they have left when the final curtain of old age falls. Going back to the Gay Pride March I notice that this is one day a year in Boston where everybody acts like brothers and sisters. There's a lot of hugging and and comaraderee. People who act like I was found under a rock the rest of the year treat me like a long lost friend. Why can't we act like this toward one another 365 days a year, regardless whether the other guy is Black, older, not terribly attractive or whatever other flaw he has. We're all flawed in one way or another. As a non recognized minority we have to stick together and open- ly embrace the new gay face seeking acceptance and commradeship. This will take a lot of work and I don't really expect to see it happen for quite a while. As a group we have a lot of neuroses to get over and a lot of growing up to do. Gay women complain to me that gay men are too flighty, irresponsible, and phony, gay men complain that the dykes are taking over the bar. I agree with the gay women. C'mon children lets get over the irrational judgements and bickering; if we don't we all go down together.....

Routine blood test shows mild anemia (low > hematocrit) and a White Blood Cell count in the low normal range. > > What is the suspect diagnosis? Oral Thrush (Candida) is diagnostic of a prounounced Cell-mediated Immune Suppression. (It also occurs during the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which eliminate native flora - and the mouth is an exceptional dirty place, so there are a lot of native flora to eliminate.) Anemia is a non-specific sign of either malnutrition or chronic disease, but can also occur independently or related to specific diseases. The white blood cell count is in the normal range. But given a Pneumonia, one would expect it to be elevated. So, seeing it in the normal range is akin to seeing it depressed. This is in agreement with the findings of oral thrush. What causes Cell-mediated immune suppression: Steroids - most commonly given for treatment of certain illnesses (iatrogenic immune suppression) but also can occur in Ovarian and Adrenal tumors, which can produce large amounts of Steroids (moreso Adrenal), or in Pituitary (Brain) Tumors, which stimulate the Adrenals by releasing the hormone ACTH. Note: Physical stress also causes release of ACTH, but the immune suppression is rarely quite this severe. Cancer - many kinds of cancer can cause both anemia (Red Blood Cell) and immune suppression (White Blood Cell decrease). In a young woman, Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Leukemia are the most commonly encountered Cancers. In the past, there would be an extensive workup looking for possible tumors. Now, the first step is a careful examination of the extremities, (What are we looking for? SEE BELOW.) or a careful sexual history. The Pneumonia: Pneumonias come in three types: Bacterial, Viral, and Fungal. Bacterial is what is generally thought of as Pneumonia classicly, and it causes the classic consolidation of lung into solid fluid and pus, visible as white on X-ray. Viral is more common in healthy people, and is self-limiting, although may cause breathing problems so bad during its course that hospitalization is necessary. This is called ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Fungal is only seen in immune suppressed patients or secondarily to TB. It's course is generally bad, not because the organism is virulent, but because the only people who get such pneumonias are dreadfully ill to begin with. A spotty interstitial type of pneumonia would be viral or fungal, or even miliary Tuberculosis (not common since the 1950s in this country) As it turned out, the patient's pneumonia was caused by the organism Pneumocystis Carinii, a protozoan. This too is seen only in immunosuppressed patients. THE DIAGNOSIS: Admitted for: ARDS (caused by Pneumocystis Carii) Underlying Condition: AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) As I noted above, examination of the extremities revealed significant needle tracks, but the hint stated that she had been referred from Methadone maintenance. Hence, she falls into the Intravenous Drug User Risk Group. Confirming the Diagnosis: #1 A differential White Blood Count was done was which revealed an inverted T4/T8 ratio (T4/T8 = 0.2) with low absolute T4 numbers Explanation: T4 cells are helper cells. T8 are both Suppressor Cells and Killer Cells (probably two cell types, but no one's yet been able to tease them apart) The ratio can be inverted because of two reasons: 1) Less Helper and More Suppressor, or 2) Simply more Killer T8s, which happens in many illnesses, but in which T4 count is normal or elevated. #2 An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed on the patient's blood, and was positive for Antibody to HTLV-3. I took a lot of time to explain this one, because two people wrote me that they had those symptoms. It was an abbreviated description, and I don't want them to think ""Oh no, I've got AIDS."" Perhaps this long differential also gave you some insight into the workings of the medical model.

It's a lot easier and cheaper to make a soldier than a doctor. Also, the level of intelligence required to be a doctor is found in a much smaller percentage of the population than that required for a soldier. I suspect the figures even out considerably if you compare dollar costs or times required for training soldiers and doctors. (You could even try summing IQ's (-: ). A more relevant question is: Can one doctor adequately serve 1,050 people? My understanding is there's currently a surplus of doctors in the United States.

My point is the following: I am sick and tired of people stating grandly on one hand that one must not generalize, and then on the other hand blasting gay men in the community for being shallow, petty, full of gossip, catty, et. al. This type of argument is contradictory, hypocritical, and divisive. Yes, I have seen the cattiness in certain circles. Yes, I am aware of the gossip in certain circles. Yes, I am aware that some gay men have problems setting goals and thinking about the future. Yes, I am aware that some gay men have difficulties having stable relationships (not exactly a unique problem considering the current divorce statistics). ***Yes, I am aware that gay men like this might compose the majority in certain gay circles.*** However, to say that these are the traits of the ""gay male community"" is rubbish. If you believe otherwise, I claim that you are not being perceptive enough, that you are only seeing what frightens you the most, what makes you most insecure about your own masculinity, and what rattles your own conception of what ""men"" or ""gay men"" should be. On the one hand, you say ""don't generalize."" On the other hand, you complain about gay men's ""fish handshakes,"" and you ""point into the mirror"" to warn us about gossipy queens (do you gossip? should you really have been pointing into a mirror?). You admire men who avoid the gay community even when the association ""would clearly be beneficial to the individual,"" but then you claim to admire lesbians because they are *more* active (politically) in the gay community (again, another generalization). If you *really* don't approve of generalizations, stop using them to ""prove"" your points. <END_OF_FLAME> ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Let me relate two quick stories to prove my point. I play for a gay men's basketball team in Boston, Massachusetts. All in all, I enjoy their company more than any gay ""group"" I have ever encountered (in the bars, in the Boston Alliance of Gay and Lesbian Youth, in a gay health club to which I belong, and in the AIDS Action Committee). For instance, one of my old boyfriends didn't know who Larry Bird was (player for the Boston Celtics professional basketball team). Unlike my old boyfriend, I could really *talk* with these guys! Finally, I had found a whole group of gay men who liked sports. However, I sensed that although these guys were easy going about traditionally masculine behavior, they were *very* uptight about anything that could be linked to being ""gay."" Since I have a limited reserve of ""Butch-ness,"" this troubled me. For instance, the first time I came to the gym to play ball with the guys, I asked if this was the gay basketball group. They all looked at me nervously; after all, I had said the forbidden ""G"" word. Time in and time out, they made it clear that they were (read: ""wanted to be"") just a bunch of ""guys"" playing basketball. During one game, a friend of mine said, ""he's such a lady; there's more Clinique on that body than is stocked in Filene's department store."" This line would have been funny if it weren't accompanied by a vicious ""I'm above all that"" sneer. I get the feeling that these guys would never watch Dynasty, wear Clinique products, shop in certain stores, listen to Disco music, or wear 501 jeans because that is ""gay"" behavior. In my opinion, if you don't like a product, don't use it; if you don't like a product because you are worried about what other people think, you are foolish. Story number 2: I just finished working out at my health club and I decided to go to the Boston Ramrod (gay bar) for a drink (a really healthy thing to do, huh?). When I walked into the bar, I noticed the usual assortment of folks (yes, the catty, gossipy people included; after all, they are the most noticeable). One guy stood out of the crowd. He was dressed in jeans, leather chaps, a ringed harness, and a leather hat. I thought he looked ridiculous! So, as I drank my beer, I imagined all sorts of sordid details about this guy in order to pass the time and to amuse myself. After all, I wouldn't be caught *dead* in an outfit like that (except on Halloween---ahem). To my surprise (I *attract* men like that?), the man approached me and we began to talk. He explained that he had read that Thursday nights were ""leather and denim"" nights at the Ramrod, and that he thought that he would be out of place if he *didn't* dress that way. He explained that he worked in Boston's financial district, lived in the area, and so forth. We had an incredibly enjoyable talk. Not once did he come-on to me (""you know how promiscuous those leathermen are""), and as a matter of fact, he expressed his joy that he found someone with which to pass the time of day. We shook hands (firmly I might add) and parted friends. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It amazes me the number of people who turn to me to tell me that the bars are only filled with nasty, gossipy queens. I wonder if those people are including themselves in that group; after all, I see them in the bars, too. It kind of reminds me of Boston's local cruising park (where men meet anonymously to have sex); nobody has ever been there, but they can all give eye-witness accounts of what goes on in the bushes. ***You can't generalize*** Under close inspection, generalizations never describe real people. We are too complex to fit into rigid stereotypes. If you choose to avoid the gay community, then you are missing the opportunity to enjoy a wide variety of people. The next time you go into a ""gay"" event, really try to notice the types of people who surround you. Especially, take time to notice the quiet ones. Appreciate the variety in our community and add your own personality to the melting pot. You and your local gay community will be richer because of it. Don't discredit the notion of community just because you differ from some gay people. We need to appreciate our differences as much as those traits we have in common. What do others think about this issue?

MANAGUA, Nicaragua --- The leftist Sandinista government has increased pressure in recent days on its opponents in political parties and in the Roman Catholic Church. The State Security Police [1] last week presented at a press conference four prisoners who, they said, were conspirators in a plan to blow up electrical towers and government warehouses in several cities. [2] Among the four was Humberto Urbina, a senior official of the moderate Social Christian Party. Although the Sandinistas presented them as confessed terrorists, statements from two of the prisoners did not refer to having participated in acts of sabotage. [3] Journalists were not allowed to question the prisoners and relatives described their behavior as abnormal. They all spoke as if trying to recite memorized lines. [4] The press conference came after Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo criti- cized the government during visits to New York and Washington last week. In a letter to the United Nations, Nicaragua's top prelate said the Sandinistas harassed some clergymen to create a ""church of silence"" here. Lino Hernandez, director of the Permanent Human Rights Commission, said the government's recent accusations are ""political blackmail to stop the cardinal."" Last Oct. 15 the government imposed a ""state of emergency,"" suspending some rights to due process and political expression. Sandinista security officials said the arrests are part of their effort to thwart the rebels, who are known as contras, from opening a secret terrorist network inside Nicaragua. [5] Since the army has forced the contras on the defensive in recent fighting in the rural mountains, officials said they expect more urban attacks. ""The mercenaries [sic., 6] have to make up for their lack of military ability with terrorism in the cities,"" said the army chief of staff, Joaquin Cuadra. Reagan administration officials have said they will seek up to $100 miliion military and ""nonlethal"" aid for the contras this year. Despite new restrictions under the state of emergency, a spokesman for the independent human rights group, Americas Watch, said that it is rare for suspects to disappear after being detained by secret police [so AW believes that ""disappearances"" HAVE occurred under the Sandinistas, even if only rarely! This is the first I've heard of it.] But there are reports of brutal interrogation. Truck driver Pablo Rafael Jacamo, 28, died three days after he was jailed by State Security Police Dec. 4 on suspicion of planting a bomb near a religious procession in the southern town of Rivas. A relative said Jacamo's bruised body was returned to his family by police, who said he died of a heart attack in prison. With the state of emergency the Sandinistas are focusing on crushing the contras, even at the risk of alienating European and Latin American supporters, Western diplomats said, ""If the dilemma is between their international image or their survival, the Sandinistas will choose to survive,"" said Rev. Cesar Jerez, Catholic University director. [7] Party and union officials said the emergency reduced the opposition's scope of operations. Social Christian leader Augustin Jarquin said the arrest of Urbina had discouraged the party from opening new headquarters in their home town of Masaya. Urbina's wife, Tomasa, was arrested with him in December. Since October the newsletters of the main opposition unions, as well as the monthly report of the independent human rights commission, have been halted by the censors. Censors have also blocked publishing of a new weekly newspaper planned by the Archdiocese of Managua. The Catholic Radio has been off the air since late December. A one-page daly bulletin criticizing the government put out by three reporters has been stopped and the writers jailed. Some opposition leaders say the current pressures are no different than the tensions of long-standing that they and the government have lived with. But Jarquin, the Social Christian leader, said: ""I told my wife if I'm arrested to remember that I haven't collaborated in any conspiracy. I told her she should not believe anything she hears me say to the contrary at a government press conference."" [8] ************************************************************************ NOTES 1 The State Security Police are headed by Nicaragua's top cop, comman- dante Tomas Borge, considered to be one of the three most powerful junta members (along with Humberto Ortega & Bayardo Arce). Borge has the vague but comprehensive & thus menacing title of Minister of the Interior. Some have alleged he's a kind of Nicaraguan Dzerzhinsky. Felix Dzerzhinsky was the founder of the Cheka, the notorious Soviet secret police; his ruthlessness and fanaticism shaped to a great extent its brutal character. I'll post some of the allegations about Borge soon. 2 The inclusion of a political moderate among the accused suggests the charges of sabotage are trumped up. If more such cases appear in the future, we may be witnessing a Nicaraguan parallel to the absurd Soviet pseudo-crime of ""wrecking"" (often conflated with conspiracy to ""wreck""), under which tens of thousands were condemned in the 30s & 40s. ""Wrecking"" was ""economic sabotage"", ie, anything the bolsheviks perceived as hindering the economy in any way: pil- ferage of a nut & bolt or disagreement over a technical problem could land one in prison as a ""wrecker."" The campaign against wrecking began as a way of eliminating technicians and engineers who weren't Party members once they were no longer indispensable, but it broadened into a means of terrorizing the entire labor force. See Solzhenitsyn's GULAG ARCHIPELAGO for many details. Fighting a serious civil war, the FSLN may be harder-pressed than the Soviets were (though even that's debatable), but, if the sabotage charges are phoney, it means that at least in this instance, the war does not so much compel the junta to be more punitive in order to survive as it offers it a stronger pretext for repression, superior to any available to the bolsheviks. 3 Despite the labor the Soviets devoted to mounting show trials, the cases made were often very sloppy and the judicial performance inept. Again, see Solzhenitsyn. 4 This observed behavior and its assessment by people familiar with the accused recurs in many Communist ""trials"", in which physical and psy- chological torture, threats against family or friends, and various forms of deprivation (sleep, human contact, food & drink) were employed. See accounts for the USSR, east Europe, China, Cuba. 5 The phrase ""secret terrorist network"" provides another eerie echo of the Soviet ""experience."" Farfetched accusations of massive fifth- column activity despite tight population control abound in Communist lands. 6 ""Mercenaries""? The contras may be very brutal, created & supplied by the CIA, and contain many ex-National Guards (many of whom are now in the FSLN, along with other fence-jumping Somocistas), but they're not foreign, or even primarily ex-soldiers. It seems most joined not mainly for thrills, money, spoils, but because they want to overthrow the FSLN. However nasty their political goals might be, their motives are political. Calling them mercenaries is not only overkill but misleading, a further smear meant to deflect attention from the shadow their existence casts on the Sandinistas. 7 Noam Chomsky said ""I never claimed they [north Vietnamese Communists] weren't tough bastards; they had to be, to survive & win [the war]"", somewhat lamely to excuse his lack of reference to their atrocities & authoritarian methods throughout his extensive writing on the Indochina War. The Rev. Jerez echoes this sentiment to my mind in rather hastily concluding that the FSLN's survival is literally at stake now. 8 Maybe a junta with a figurehead who sports designer sunglasses will regale us with ""press conferences"" instead of show trials. Or maybe it's just too lazy to bother with ponderous judicial forms. I guess we'll have to wait for the next installment to find out. BTW, I'm writing a lengthy review of messrs. Myers' & A. Berman's reading lists, and a brief article on the double standards of some human rights groups when Nicaragua is involved. My heavy workload permitting, I'll post them soon.

Perhaps the U.S. might have some influence with the Nicaraguan government if it hadn't been so hasty to torpedo the Contadora process.

Other events include music (rock, jazz, others), readings by Allen Ginsburg, a holography lecture/demonstation, an original play (""Pilgrims"", by Rodney Hudson), some movies (including ""Buddies""), children's day on Saturday, and a closing memorial service on Sunday. The really neat thing about this whole event (based on my reading of the Globe's article) is that it is essentially the work of the University community, and not that of activists. The Globe credited a Harvard senior as being the primary force behind the event, while my schedule indicates that it is being funded by a number of Harvard/Radcliffe organizations.

I keep reading things that say, in effect ""why do anything aboutpeople infected with the virus since the they may not develop aids?"" Thepoint that is missed with this idiocy is that most people are not opposed toindividuals walking around with fatal conditions, but rather to individualswalking around who can give them a fatal condition. I know of no one whothinks heart patients, emphysema patients, etc. should be quarantined, eventhough the may drop dead at any moment, because their afflictions cannot harmothers. Nevertheless, many states restrict people with active tuberculosisfrom holding certain jobs, and restrict people with untreated epilepsy fromperfroming certain task, because their afflictions can harm other people.If AIDS was not contagious, or if people with full blown AIDS were notcontagious, society would probably be a lot less concerned about peoplewith AIDS walking about. But the odds are that anyone who tests positiveto HTLVIII is infectious, and possibly more infectious than individualswho are symptomatic. Therefore whether an infected individual ever actuallycomes down with AIDS or ARC is beside the point to society at large.Studies in some prisons have shown that much less than half of the inmateshave been exposed to the virus. Although it may be unfair to make someonewho sells heroin spend a few years (or maybe months, giving sentencing in thiscountry) alone because he has been infected, it doesn't seem as unfair assentencing another inmate to death when he is gang raped by one or moreinfected individuals.

There is *no* proof or evidence to show that anyone who tests HTLV3positive is infectious. There is evidence to suggest that those who test HTLV3postive have between a 10 and 15% chance of being diagnosed with one or moreof the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS within 5 years aftertesting HTLV3 positive.

The AIMS (Advanced Investigation of Medical Science) Group and the Institute for Cancer Research, both located in the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco, are the authors of the proposal. Both groups have a history of military research. The AIMS Group has performed classified research on biological and chemical warfare. The goals of the study discount the considerable body of scientific evidence that AIDS is not casually transmitted. The proposal identifies Stanford and the Hoover Institute as subcontractors responsible for research on the ethical and legal issues of identification and containment.

However, the jury is still out on female prostitutes. Female to male transmission of AIDS is not so well documented. A recent medical study reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said female to male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of a risk. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi- mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual. That amounts to about 160 people. The CDC also said that of the 160 cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men. Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and of these 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a female prostitute to a client. Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmed transmissions from female to male. If experts in Africa have good reason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has been vaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant male clients"", then clearly something is seriously different between there and here.

It then describes an extreme and rare form of female circumscription -- infibulation. Infibulation is found only in a part of northeastern Africa (1), outside the region where AIDS has been reported,and is very different in its social and biological effects from the kind of female circumcision that is practiced more widely in Africa. A secondary problem with the logic of hypothesizing that AIDS is transmitted by traditional custom is that in Africa it appears to be primarily an urban disease, as it is in the United States. Traditional customs, such as female circumcision, have their origins in the rural sector. I think it would be more productive to look at data pertaining to life in African cities and to examine such phenomena as male labor migration, often described as being disurptive to marriage and family life.""

I think it's interesting that you deleted the part of my posting that read, ""It's not like this is keeping me up nights or anything. I'm just curious."" No, I am not interested in having sex with Burt Reynolds. I simply find it intriguing, *and* very sad, that actors have to put up such a ""front"" for their supposedly ""loving"" public, instead of being accepted for what they are. This goes for everyone, actually, not just actors. Look at Rock Hudson, who struggled to keep his real self a secret for 30-odd years. Sure, I'd like to see the day when everybody can feel comfortable with their sexuality, no matter what it is. Until then, no matter how an actor or actress feels towards members of the same sex, they'll have to put on an act of being real womanizers or...manizers?

I'll try to bebreif about this, so don't interpret my short explinations as lack ofthough :-) Here goes...1) ""Us Look Bad""a) There is nothing wrong with sexual advertising/articles in somegay magazines in my mind. In think someone elses comment (forgotthe name) that there are (or should be) enough gay publicationsthat they will cater to various likes/dislikes is very apt. Itnot only applies to whether people like/dislike sexual items butalso any like/dislike. (""Where can I find a literay rag with somesexual stuff, and just the right blen of politics, etc..."")b) Someone else said that the commonality of being gay was essentiallybeing sexual with a member of the same sex. I couldn't disagreemore. The commonality of being gay is having a 'deep' relationshipwith a member of the same sex. Now 'deep' may mean sexual for someand may mean marriage for others and may mean any range of thingsin between - but I feel the essence is the same sex reltaion part,not just what that relation is.2) ""Effeminate behavior""I, too, am a little put off by the article form the MIT person regardingeffeminate behavior. I have known many effeminate men (or rather manyman with a range of 'effeminate' behaviors) both straight and gay. Thekey is that with social acceptance people with behave as they feel mostnatural and that's fine with me if it's leather butch or raging queen oranywhere in between. And furthermore, I hope that we stop thinking interms of catagories of behavior, since people change or time and circustance:I can be 'straight looking/acting' (st lkg/actg :-) as well as swish.It depends on how I feel at the time...3) ""Children""Damn it, children are a burning gay topic!

It's just too bad thatwhen CBS news reports on ""gay men"", they show two clones in SF walkingdown a street, wearing leather jackets and holding hands. It's abouttime that the rest of the USA realizes that there are gay men (andwomen) EVERYWHERE, and not just in the ``gay ghettos'' that the mediashows us. BEFORE someone screams, I have NOTHING against those twoguys in SF. What's important is that the gay community is diverse, inmore than one direction.A good friend of mine has been working for IBM in New York State.He's afraid to ever come out to the people he works with there, and hedoesn't care so much about his friends in Boston. Why is this? InBoston, people have a more even view of homosexuality. Theyunderstand that just 'cause you're gay doesn't make you better, worse,funnier, sadder, fatter, thinner, more perverted, less perverted, etcthan anyone else. Up in the sticks where he works, though, gay isidentified with AIDS, bathhouses, perversion, child molestation, andthe like.I know that the picture that I'm painting is black and white, and thereal situation is much grayer. Good 'ole Dapper O'Neil, probably themost homophobic politician that the Boston City Council has ever seen,regularly insults the sexual preferences of David Scondras, anotherCity Council member. There are plenty of good people at IBM who knowthe real story, and wouldn't harass anyone.I havn't done this much flaming since I was responding to Arndt'sarticles more than a year ago.

Comment,FT265CM05,,FT265,CM05,,1986,1986-02-19,16:59:26,Christopher Young,"Young, Christopher",,1,A0072,,,A0072,Weird Concepts!,Net.motss,"Reading the various postings about ""straight acting gays"" and""enjoying the diversity of gay culture"", etc., has brought somethoughts to mind which I'd like to share. They are thoughts abouthow we, as gay people, behave and the pressures put upon us to behaveone way or another.One the interesting points is that whenever somebody says somethingabout ""straight- acting"", somebody responds with ""what about gayacting""? It comes to mind that many of us are indeed acting. In fact,this is one of the aspects of the gay community that bothers me so much(though I'm aware it is also existant in the ""straight"" community, thoughI think to a less conscious extent).Why can't people just be themselves? Why do they have to ""act""? I knowthat sometimes I am the object of scorn because I act the way I am. Ihear garbage like ""still think you're straight, girl?"", or ""why doyou act so butch?"", or ""can't handle the gay life, huh?"", etc. I wishI could type a sneer, because that is usually in the quote, too. Thereare a large number of people who seem to believe that if you're gay, youhave to behave in a certain fashion. And this is definitely not anexclusively straight concept; gays tend to strongly stereotype themselvesin roles which it seems ""straight society"" has created and which ""gaysociety"" seems bent on perpetuating. Either your femme, or your macho,but the middle ground isn't always very well accepted. So my first pointis, it seems to be that, in looking for an ""acceptable"" way to behave,many gay people take on stereotypical roles and resent those who don'tas traitors.Personally, I can't stand being called a girl or ""Mary"". This isbecause I am neither a girl nor is my name Mary. And I don't feelcomfortable with people who act out stereotypes, regardless of whetherit is butch or femme. Why? Because people who are acting out stereotypesdo not strike me as sincere. It is, for me, a very weird experience totalk to somebody who needs a 3 foot clearance to walk somewhere becauseof hip movement, and it is equally weird to talk to somebody swathed inleather and chains. Of course these examples are exagerated. I'm notgoing to give a detailed account of every example I can think of. Thepoint is, though, that it is hard to want to be associated with somebodywho's just putting on an act. I know somebody is going to say ""howcan you tell if somebody's putting on an act? Maybe that's how theyreally are."" They won't like my answer, either. But I believe a personcan feel when somebody is just affected, and not being themselves. Ibelieve there are undoubtedly cues given off by the person, but I can'tlist them now. (maybe if somebody flames me I'll try to analyse the cues).What I can say is that my judgement of character has so far tended to beaccurate.I really don't perceive myself as being macho butch or femme. Just asme. I think one of the things I value the most is my individuality. Itend to resist strongly suggestions that I behave like one thing oranother. This goes for more than ""acting gay"" or ""acting gay"", too. Ifsomebody points out what they think is a flaw in me, and I think theyhave a point, then I try to change. But I will not conform to a stereotypedeliberately. And as far as feminine and masculine qualities are concerned,my belief is that any normal person has a mixure of both. And we shouldbe glad for that. It's the Tao. Feminine and masculine qualities arejust labels anyway. But most of all, I feel I get closer to my own balance,and that is ultimately who I am (ie., I figure out more of myself).I know people who are naturally feminine and naturally masculine, too. Thatdoesn';t bother me. And again, I know it's not a show because I canfeel they are not acting; they are just being who they are. I thinkpeople should just be who they are, is the point of this post. Allthe pretentious hogwash does nobody good.By the way, it's been my experience that gay couples, especially theso-called ""straight- acting"" ones, do tend to leave the gay subculturebehind, at least to some degree, as noted by Andrew Gerber. This isnot surprising since relationshipsrequire time and effort, so there is less time to engage in othersocial activities. This is true of straight couples too.",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/yDpYsSJlD5A/m/VnIbR5F5fucJ,,,

And I suspectwhat happened is this:In the earlier days of the gay liberation movement, many gay thinkers(including yours truly) realized there were lots of gay behaviors thatreally didn't need any apologizing for and that, in fact, on closerexamination they were actually quite parallel to more traditionallyacceptable behavior. Many thought, ""We don't need to apologize fordrag. After all the person who works in the financial district putson a costume of a suit/tie to *show* others how he fits in andis successful -- isn't that drag?""And so, I suspect, the concept of drag was extended to *any mode ofdress*. And any mode of dress was considered a costume of one sort or another,but a costume, and therefore a put-on, nevertheless. This was thenused as a rationalization for dressing in whatever way one wantedand for thinking that wearing a costume wherever one pleased shouldnot be looked on as ""wrong"" or ""improper"".I think an important distinction was missed in that line of thinking,being the *intention* a person has in dressing a certain way.The intention makes the difference in whether a set of clothes isa costume or not. *To the extent* that you put on some clothes withthe intention of them making a statement about yourself, it is a costume.When a gay man puts on a leather outfit before going cruising at aleather bar in order to demonstrate ""I am a tough MAN, and I am goingto treat you rough."", that's a costume. When a gay man puts on acowboy hat before going out socially so that others with think ofhim as a cowboy for their sexual fantasy, that is a costume. Whena business man deliberately selects a certain suit or certainattache case because they connote success, that is a costume.However, there are complications to this analysis.One is the difference between the intent the wearer had in putting on certainclothes and the intent the viewer *infers* that the wearer had in puttingon those clothes.The second is that once a costume becomes comfortable and commonplace for aperson, the person may put it on *without* the intent that he used to have.Then it no longer becomes a costume. Many styles of dress that were originallycostumes in the gay ghetto have become commonplace modes of dress over time.Many gay men on Castro Street wear leather outfits casually (I suspect)simply because (I suspect) they just like that look and they feel comfortabledressing that way. However, to someone outside that community, the clothesstill appear to be a costume, because he infers an intended *statement* inthe clothes.The third complication is that intent (in *any* area of behavior) canbe conscious as well as unconscious. I can imagine someone arguing thatin the case of the leather outfit worn ""casually"", the intent of makingthe ""I-am-your-sexual-fantasy"" statement has merely become unconscious.I think this analysis of the concept of ""drag"" can be applied to manyof the non-traditional behaviors (e.g. put-on effeminacy and camping)common in the gay ghetto. The extent to which a gay communitybecomes a ghetto and in-grown, certain behaviors that were originallydone ""for effect"" grow to be casual, and appear (wrongly or rightly)to be ""affected"" to the person outside that community.",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/yDpYsSJlD5A/m/KqPScFyk2pYJ,,,

I think a lot of things in the gay community arechanging now like they have never changed before. The changes I amthinking of are not changes becasue of AIDS, but becasue of thetolerence of gays that has started in the last 15 years.Here at MIT we have an on-campus gay student group calledGAMIT, for Gays at MIT. Although I am not currently as active in thegroup as I once was, I have been exposed to many students from variouscolleges around the country, and heard much about gay student groupsaround the country.None of these gay student groups were around 20 years ago.GAMIT started as the ""Student Homophile League"" about 15 years ago.That was relativly early, compared to other school's student groups,many which have only been around for the last five or so years.What I am trying to get to get to here is the early acceptanceof homosexuality. Yes, there are plenty of effeminate people aroundthe Boston college groups. But there are plenty of completly normalacting ones. It's amazing when new people show up at a gay stuedntgroup - many of them ALREADY act effemiate before they 'come out'.Many others never act effeminate. A few latch onto the 'dishing'etc., and grow more effeminate as time goes on.I sincerly believe that as homosexuality is more accepted, andthe traditional sterotypes melt away, so will the effeminate gay men.Of the many young gay men I know (17-23 yrs old), only about 1/4 ofthem would I say ""act gay"". Not that there's anything wrong withacting gay. Some people use it as a personal identity - for others,they fall in with a bunch of gay friends who all act effeminate andwill follw suit.When I first came out, I was amazed by the number of guys whoI met were effemniate. My gut reaction always was ""I'm gay becasue Ilike men -- not men who act like women"".Unfortunatly, it's the straight acting homosexual who is nevercounted - the news programs miss him, he finds a lover, and vanishessomewhere in the suburbs. (See the New York Times, 2/11/86, frontpage, second section)I'd like to go twenty years in the future and see whatpeople's stereotype of a homosexual is. AIDS will change things,promescuity is out. Friends are in. Safe sex is in. I never thoughtI'd have my father asking me if I was using condoms.....What do you think the future holds? Of your friends, how manyare effemniate?

In fact,I know you did.What I was trying to say was that as homosexuality is moreaccepted, people will find it less neccesary to act effeminate and bethe ""typical"" homosexual that is often thought of by the media, bystraight adults, etc.. Did you ever see Mel Brooks ""To be or Not tobe""? The homosexual from that movie is an example of the sterotypicalhomosexual that so many people carry around in their minds.Everyone should be exactly what they want to be. They shouldact exactly as they feel like acting. WHAT I WANT is enough freedomso people won't FEEL that to be gay, they need to act like women, use'she' when talking about a guy, etc. If they WANT to do that, letthem have fun doing it! But I think the whole desire to act that wayARISES from the sterotypical view of homosexuals that exists in oursociety.Think of it this way. When someone is coming out, when theyare finally realizing what they are - unless they have a gay brother,a gay friend, etc, they have NO OTHER VIEW of homosexuals except forthose that they see in the media, from their parents, and from whattheir friends tell them. IF YOU REMEMBER, THIS ISN'T VERYCOMPLIMENTARY! It's full of words like ""fairy"", ""sissy"", ""queer"", andothers I'd rather not repeat.So what do you do? Well, you just might start acting they wayyou ""think"" you're supposed to act. Like the media view ofhomosexuals. By doing this, you help fuel the continuance of theseviews. In some ways, you're letting the outside world (straight)determine what you act/look/talk like.In terms of ""differences"", I didn't say anything against {black,white, red, green, tall, short, *} people in my posting.--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Andrew S.

I haven't really thought this outan awful lot, but I tend to agree. On the one hand, these men are saying ""Whyshould everyone conform to your view of sexuality, of how men should act?"" Onthe other hand, they go and act like society's image of women. They cast offone restricting stereotype to adopt another. (I know, it's none of my businesshow people act, they should be the way want to be.)By the way, there's a movie on CBS this Saturday night called ""Welcome Home,Bobby"" about a teenage boy who gets involved with an older man.

We all agree that diversity is our strength, and that weshouldn't retain the xenophobia that is associated with thesociety-at-large. Maybe once upon a time it was a survival trait;thankfully that's not true anymore.Before we all dump on Andrew, think back to what you thought aboutother gay men (stereotypes), before you figured out that what societytaught you was a bunch of crap. And if you never had to endure SmallTown Homophobia, because there was a GLYNY or a BAGLY where you grew upor otherwise, be very glad of that.When I first came out in high school, I had a lot of the same attitudes(misconceptions) that Andrew seems to have. I had them mostly becauseI grew up in Small Town America (Vermont) and had never known any othergay men. So I formed my own little view of the world. To make myselfacceptable with my straight (and prejudiced) friends, and realizingthat I didn't fit any of the stereotypes that I knew of, I did somedumping on the stereotypes.Well, I know I was wrong, but I also know that if I had had to maintainmy self esteem with no support whatsoever from the friends that I had,I would have ended up much more messed up than I did. I was not secureenough to set out on my own to find gay friends, I was underage, and Iwas living in a state (an entire state) that had only one gay bar, andeven that was constantly closing and opening under new management. Itis about seven years later now, and I know better.""Effeminate"" is a bad word to describe what Andrew (and everybody else)means. We all know that if a woman acted ""effeminate"" we'd all thinkshe was a drag queen.When I was in high school, a friend of mine met my lover, who had beenout longer than I and was much less uptight about being camp than I.The friend asked my lover why he acted so much like a girl. Just thenthree pieces of blonde female fluff walked by, tittering amongthemselves. My lover exclaimed ""I act like that?!"" It showed thatwhat my friend was calling effeminate was not at all feminine, it wasjust different.

You may respond to the net or Steve Dyer will relay mail back to me. I am a computer professional, single, in my early thirties, and bisexual. I am still quite confused about my sexuality despite having stuck one or more feet out of the closet as long as 15 years ago. I am currently in psychotherapy with a ""non-aligned"" therapist (probably Jungian at heart) who at least professes to believe that people are innately bisexual; no fighting a therapist who wants to *change* me. (How many therapists does it take to change a light bulb? One, but the light bulb really has to want to change.) A little background: My first sexual experience was at 10 or 11. It was with my best friend B. I don't remember who initiated the encounters, but after a while it definetly was me who initiated. Aside from an adult Boy Scout leader, Mr. R, whose initiation rites were a bit outside of social acceptability (the Patrol leader and assistant were blindfolded and ""made"" to 69) I never had what could be termed a seductive experience. Incidently the adult leader was married, a pillar of the community etc. and included his son in the initiations! His son and I, being the youngest, did not have explicitly sexual rites but did watch the other's which were sexual. The reason I mention this is that a lot of people are horrified when I mention this and say that I was sexually abused by this pillar (:-) and that even now, over 20 years later, I should press charges or something absurd like that. My personal reaction is that Mr. R, while a sicky, did not harm me and after one season of taking us for overnights did not continue. I, on the other hand, had *very* strong cravings for sex and seduced, or attempted to seduce, a number of peers. Around the age of 14 B's hetero feelings starting to blossom and he starting treating me abusely (not physically, just socially). Things never were emotional between us, we never caressed or kissed or proclaimed love etc. but I guess he felt guilty and wanted to distance himself. Didn't stop him from calling when ""he had the urge"" (of course I was allways willing). I guess that, my sister seducing another friend (she later claimed she did not know there was anything between us), and that asshole Dr David Rueben's _Everything_You_Wanted_To_Know_About_Sex_ (but couldn't find an educated homophobe to tell you) starting seriously eroding my self confidence. My own hetero feelings were starting at the same time but lacking friends and having miserable role models of parents I never dated or any of the other ""normal"" adolescent activities. When I was invited to a birthday party for one of my mother's friend's children, I got sick the day of the party because of my anxiety over going and playing spin the bottle. The years 14-16 were the first part of my crazy years: drug use, running away from home (hum, in restrospect I'm don't think that was so crazy, my home was *very* nutty), declining scholastic achievment (I was considered very gifted but my parents chose to ignore the pleas of school officials to place me in a school for gifted). Anyhow, to cut thru the wallowing self pity, them years was very painful. Around my 17th birthday (drivers license time) I discovered a Gay org at the local college and, at least partially, came out. No fan-fairs, earth shaking, or most disappointing, personal problems disappearing. My first hetero experience was that summer. It was with the best friend of my ""girlfriend"" (I was a just a friend to her, she tolerated my clumsy attempts to go to bed with her). My GF not only knew about me and her friend, she let us use her bedroom while she listened from the guest room. From a physical standpoint the experience was okay, emotionally it did nothing for me (she left in the middle of the night and seemed uneasy around me after that, she was drunk and had been hinting and I propositioned her). My college years were bitter-sweet. A lot of promiscuous sex with men and a lot of attempting sex in relationships with female friends. I managed a few times. I was *very* out of the closet my freshman year (except to family, going to a school far from home) but went back in after that because I got too turned off my the campy/sarcastic people active in the local gay org. After college things a few things changed, I had a long term affair. (""remember"", said N, married he, ""if things get emotional I will stop this like that"" (snap of fingers). Aside from that limitation (which delighted me, being as the last thing *I* wanted was an emotional relationship with a man) it was a good relationship. We had a good time together, doing non-sexual things more than sexual. He insisted that I meet his family (gulp!) who did not know what our relationship really was. They thought (or did a damn good job of pretending) that he was simply befriending another stray pup. In the middle of that relationship I got involved with a women who lived in my apartment building. N, considerately, dropped the sexual portion of our friendship for the duration. L and I lived together for three months and they were hell. She was crazier than I was! I couldn't adjust to her sexual cycle (3 AM, and only when she wanted it) and she didn't give a damn about mine (any time, especially 7 AM). I learned alot about JAP foreplay (two hours of begging and pleading). I was so desperate that even suspecting that she was cheating on me I proposed to her. Thank god she said no! The relationship ended when she borrowed my car, failed to pick me up that night, and returned the next morning man in tow (a neighbor later told me they spent the night in his apt.). That evening I seduced (for lack of better term) a male friend and shortly thereafter resumed sex with N. That was 9 years ago. Two years later I spoiled a fine platonic friendship with a women by ignoring her lack of interest in a deeper relationship and bugging the shit out of her. After that I immersed myself in the bath house scene, until three years ago when I went celibate because of AIDS fears. A little over a year ago I staring going to female prostitutes because ""I was getting crazy for sex"" (yes, I masturbated all the time, no real relief). When I heard that they thought prostitutes were HTLV-3 carriers I stopped going (about 6 months ago) waited for 8 weeks and got the AIDS antibody test (negative). During this time a female friend (yep, you guessed it!) We never got sexual, the feelings just got too crazy. After that I went back to the prostitute twice: first time was okay but I could have done as good a job myself, second time I couln't touch her, the only way I could orgasm was to pretend that I was having sex with a man. I left convinced that there was proof that I am not bisexual, that I am 100% percent homophile. My therapist sees that experience as evidence that I am in better touch with my needs (emotional and compassionate) and I just felt the emptiness a bit earlier than usual (usually the ""glow"" fades about 10 minutes after I'm done). I am toying with the idea of going back to the Gay community, recent contacts with it have shown me that there does exist a ""healthy"" (non-role playing monogamous) sub- community. My real concern is that the problems with women are not just with women and that I will en up with the same shit in a relationship with a man. I might add, as an aside, that I find women *much* more sexually attractive than men but enjoy sex better with a man. I may have hurt the women that I have involved with; certainly I have hurt myself (and two of three hurt me). I guess I'm just very confused and looking for people whose life experiences have similarities to mine who have worked thru the shit.

On that episode, an old friend of Sam's (who happens to have been a teammate on his professional baseball team) comes out as a gay man during a publicity show for his new book. This part of the show happens in the first five to ten minutes and the rest of the show illustrates how people react to the news once the gay character is off-stage. Sam is hurt and confused by the confession (""Yunno, why can't guys be guys?""); Dianne is cool and calm; and, Norm starts to get nervous that Cheers is going to become a gay bar once all the gay men find out how open Sam is to gay people. When a good-looking, well dressed couple of young men go up to the bar and order a light beer, Norm is convinced that the gay invasion has started. The couple admits that they read in the paper about Sam's reaction to his buddy's comming out, and that they admire him for his stance. Dianne adds fuel to the fire by stating to Norm that she knows for a fact that there are two gay men in the bar ""right at this very moment."" Norm organizes everyone else in the bar, and then procedes to go to ridiculous lengths to drive the two young men out of the bar. After he finally succeeds, Norm gloats about his success. Unfortunately for him, Dianne tells him that the two gay men are still in the bar. At which point, the two men on either side of Norm (older, graying, balding, casually dressed) lean toward him and kiss him on the cheek. [the curtain falls] That's my favorite gay-themed TV show because it doesn't preach about being gay or having AIDS, but it delivers the message in a powerful way that we are everywhere and we're not all that different from you and yours.

""Parting Glances"" is a brief look into the lives of Michael and Robert, who've been together for five years, their relationship, and the various relationships between them and their friends. The title of the movie is derived from two imminent departures. Robert, who works for the International Health Organization (or was it the World H. O.?) is about to leave for Africa, where he has been assigned to what is officially expected to be a two year tour of duty. In the meantime, Michael's closest friend Nick has AIDS, so that Michael has to cope with losing the two people who are closest to him (even though Robert's transfer is acknowledged to be temporary). We also get to meet Robert's boss Cecil and his wife Betty, at a going away dinner that they give for Robert and Michael. Betty knows the two are lovers, but believes that Cecil has blinded himself to that fact. The truth is that Cecil knows, and it is Betty who is blind to Cecil's fondness for members of the same sex. Yet this situation gives rise to an observation by Betty that is one of the main points being made by the movie, namely that in any love relationship there is a ""kisser"" and a ""kissee"", that is, one who gives the bulk of the affection, and the other who agrees to receive it. In her case, she is the kisser, and is quite content with Cecil's limited need for affection, even though she doesn't know his reasons. However, we can easily apply her insight to Robert and Michael, since we see that it is almost always Robert who initiates the physical affection between the two. Later, we start to understand the relationship between Michael and Robert a little better. We learn about Michael's long standing and greater love for Nick, while it is Robert's insecurity that forces him to plan on being away until after Nick dies. In spite of the imperfections in their relationship, and the few occasions that the movie threaten's us with the possiblity of a break-up, we are always supported with signals of stability that reassure us about the success of their relationship. I believe we get to see the complexity behind Betty's oversimplification, and thus learn that the best couplings are not built on the greatest love. One thing I liked about the movie was the honesty of the characters to themselves. While they weren't always honest to each other about their feelings, I think that each person knew his or her own feelings -- even Robert, who knew he was confused. Michael could talk about his love for both Robert and Nick, and I believe knew why he was coupled with Robert, even though his love for Nick was greater. In spite of Cecil's covert rompings, both he and Betty understood that their relationship was built primarily on a Platonic sort of love, every bit as important as erotic love. Even Nick understands the depression that has hit him because of his illness, although he depends on Michael for staying afloat. Some secondary points: Even though one of the major supporting characters has AIDS, this is clearly a movie about people, and not about the disease. While the sound quality could have been better (and this may have been the fault of the theater, not the movie), overall the technical quality was excellent, given the limited market for the film, and presumably the limited resources of the producers; the cinematography is basic, but professional; the dialogue and acting flow smoothly, and is never forced; the love scenes are neither exploitative nor sanitized, but are quite comparable to what we might expect from a Hollywood PG-13 or soft R heterosexual love scene. Since stereotypes are a hot topic on motss these days, I admit to having detected a bit of the New York City guppy stereotype in the film. Michael and Robert are both handsome, white, young professionals (but at least they're not doctors nor lawyers; Robert is a health administrator, while Michael is an editor). Their apartment is Upper West Side (I think, but it might have been Prospect Park or some other -uppie NY neighborhood), but is discreetly furnished and not particularly gay. The friends we see at a second going away party, given by their artist friend Jean, are, however, very stereotypical chic (the sort we might expect to show up at a Woody Allen party, if he were to ever film a NY artist's party that was 60% gay). While I may be overly sensitive to the stereotype (being an ex-New Yorker myself), I wasn't offended by it, since the characters weren't plastic. In summary, I left the theater feeling good, with a renewed faith in the future of gay life. I give ""Parting Glances"" 3 1/2 stars; don't miss it.

However,the jury is still out on female prostitutes. Female to maletransmission of AIDS is not so well documented. A recent medicalstudy reported in the _American_Journal_of_Medicine_ said femaleto male transmission of the disease is unlikely and not much of arisk. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of approxi-mately 16,000 AIDS cases, only one percent are heterosexual. Thatamounts to about 160 people. The CDC also said that of the 160cases, 90 percent are women who have contracted AIDS from men.Only 20 men, said the CDC, have contracted AIDS from women, and ofthese 20 cases only one case is thought to have been from a femaleprostitute to a client.Out of 16 *thousand* cases of AIDS in America, only *20* are confirmedtransmissions from female to male. If experts in Africa have goodreason to believe ""that the primary vector for African AIDS has beenvaginal intercourse between female prostitutes and their itinerant maleclients"", then clearly something is seriously different between thereand here.

I have recently gotten involved again with N.A.G. (Nashua Area Gays) and have moderated a few meetings. The group's made up of a mixed bag of people from 20 to 75 years of age and covering approximately a 30 mile radius. N.A.G. has been a viable entity for over 8 years now and the mailing list has about 150-200 names on it; the meet- ings attended mostly by the same 25-40 men every week. We will be having a quarterly ""what do we do for the next 3 months?"" planning meeting soon and one problem is finding new/interesting topics and activities for the group. The group members complain about not social- izing outside of the weekly Monday night meetings, but whenever an outside social event is planned very few show up. Most members are non closeted, except for some of the older ones. I told the group I would ask the net how other groups around the country keep themselves forward moving and successful. We seem to be running out of subject matter/activities. Below is a list of things we've done over the years, any new/different/fun things not listed here greatly appreciated. Anyone who may live in the general area and who hasn't heard of N.A.G. but would like to attend a Monday night meeting can send me personal mail and I'll give you details. A $3 donation is requested per meeting to cover rental of the church's meeting room, supplies and kitchen privileges. Thanks, Ray We have ruminated, obsessed, discussed, beat to death the following topics: o AIDS and how it's affected the way we live and interact with others Safe sex practices and every other AIDS related topic. o Coming out to parents and other family members, coworkers and superiors, husbands and wives, church pastors, friends. o Coming out stories, sharing of funny, sad, etc stories about when we first realized we were gay. o How you made a relationship work, open communication, honesty, etc. Also talks on getting out of bad relationships o Surviving the loss of a lover through death or breakup. o Friends as family, developing close knit networks. o Alcoholism and drug abuse in the gay community. o Suicide and other emotional crises. o Pederasty, boy lovers o Drag queens, gender fuck, transsexuals, etc. o Aging in the gay community with all it's related issues o Wills and other legal issues between gay couples. o Security clearance hassles and blackmail. o Pornography, morality of it, who use it and when. o Bars and bar behavior, coping with the environment. o Users, losers, liars, etc. Feelings about same. o S & M, Bondage and other non mainstream sex practices. also sex toys and how people feel about them. o Gays and their relationship to religions. o Alternatives to the bars as meeting places. o Fag bashing and homophobia. o Closeted gays, why they stay there, why we stayed there. o Showing public affection, feelings about it and also the morality of sex in public places; parks, beaches. o Gay vacation spots, sharing favorite resort info. o Coping with the holidays, depression, loneliness (every holiday season this gets discussed at one or more meetings). o How we feel about the way the media portrays gay men to the general public. o Gay stereotypes; effeminacy, butchness, etc is it necessary/natural to some men. o Sharing of favorite sexual/non-sexual fantasies. o Rejection, loneliness and coping with ""Lookism"". o Hobbies, sharing a favorite pastime/craft with the group. o Personal ads, discussion, then everyone writes an add and the moderator reads each one, group commenting on ad content and style. o Getting arrested, getting fired and other negative run ins with mainstream authority figures because of being gay. o Roommate and other living arrangements. o Multi question surveys, handed out, completed and the results discussed at a future meeting.

Aside from the obvious issues of stigmatization andconfidentiality, they ask men who are concerned about HTLV-III exposureand are considering being tested:""What would you do differently, if you knew?""They argued pretty persuasively against being tested, for the followingreasons:1.) a negative test is no license for increased sexual activity(to be meaningful, you'd have to be tested weeks to months aftereach new sexual partner, when in the meantime, you could be spreadingthe virus.) In essence, every gay man should be behaving as if he wereexposed, regardless of the test results.2.) Denial (as in not knowing one's HTLV-III exposure) can be thought of ashaving some positive effects.

I asked my doctorwhat his advice is to patients who test negative (no HTLV-III virus), andhe said that he recommends following the safe sex guidelines and reducingthe number of sex partners, to avoid exposure to the virus. Then I askedwhat his advice is to patients with the virus, and his advice was the same,to avoid exposing their partners.The ""relief"" I might feel from a negative test result would in no wayoffset the anxiety I would certainly feel if I tested positive.

Comment,FT274CM01,,FT274,CM01,,1986,1986-03-16,18:01:49,Gary Feldman,"Feldman, Gary",,1,A0147,,,A0147,HTLVIII Testing,Net.motss,"Some comments on LAV/HTLV-III testing, research studies, and telling partners.A few years ago I signed up for an AIDS research study being done by theUniversity of Pittsburgh, as part of a four city project funded by the NationalInstitutes of Health (the other cities are, to the best of my recollection,Baltimore, Chicago, and San Francisco). The study started before HTLV-IIIhad even been identified, and thus part of the goal of the study was to trackthe factors that may be involved in causing AIDS. I had no reservations aboutjoining, since I have a very strong belief in empirical research (I sign up forhuman interface studies at every opportunity, and always used to participate inpsych experiments as an undergraduate).Volunteers in the study came in twice a year to be interviewed on sexualpractices, undergo a physical, and give samples of blood (over a dozen vials ata time; ouch), urine, semen (this was the fun part) and stool (blech! I can'tsee myself ever getting into scat). I knew at the time that a portion of myblood would be frozen, to undergo whatever testing might become available at afuture time. However, I hadn't really thought about the implications of a testfor a virus (or, as it turns out, antibodies to a virus), and I certainly hadn'tthought about many of the political and personal issues.In retrospect, the only surprise was that the virus and tests were discovered soquickly; I would have signed up for the study even after LAV/HTLV-III had beenidentified. Why? Because we still don't know why only a small percentage ofinfected people actually come down with AIDS, and hence this sort of research isvery important.I should also add that this particular study has been granted some sort ofinsurance of confidentiality by the Feds. I'm not quite sure what this implies,but presumably it means that their records are more protected than a countyHTLV-III testing program for example. On the other hand, this certificate wasgiven after I signed up for the study, so confidentiality obviously wasn't apriority to me.Once HTLV-III testing became available, the study did indeed retrieve the storedblood, and start testing all of the participants. (Nothing underhanded; we knewthat the potential for this was there when we signed up, although I suspect mostvolunteers, like myself, hadn't thought about it very much.) However, it wasentirely up to us as to whether we wanted to learn the results. One of therequirements for getting your results was that you had to participate in a groupdiscussion session and an individual counseling session before any HTLV-IIIresults would be revealed. I think this was an excellent idea, far better thanthe health department testing mills, even though I had to pull strings to bypassthis requirement (since I moved to New England before my results wereavailable).As I just indicated, I decided to find out what my results were. Mostly thiswas for my own peace of mind (although, if the tests had turned out positive, itwould have proved that the virus had a much longer incubation period thatpreviously suspected :-). But also it was to help me decide how to lead mylife. I think that if I had tested positive I would either a) decided to remaincelibate, which is close to what I've been doing anyway; b) limited my dating toother men who tested positive, either through support groups or candid personalads; or c) limited my sexual activity to strictly safe, kinky stuff with littleor no chance of emotional attachments forming.Which brings me to the last question, namely should a person who test positiveinform partners? My response, as indicated, is that I would choose to avoidsituations in which this was likely to become an issue. I could not see myselfdating someone while burdened by the constant anxiety of knowing that someday Iwould have to reveal this information if the relationship is going to continue.I know this is evasive to some extent, since avoiding such situations doesn'tinsure that they won't occur. I can't honestly say what I would do if I werein such a situation, although I like to think I would find the courage to behonest from the start. I guess I'm lucky in knowing that I won't be in thatsituation at all.The other side of the coin is how would I feel if I were going with someone whorevealed to me that he tests positive. I have a close friend who is positive,so I know I can be with someone who's positive without freaking out (which isnot to say I have no anxieties, but only that they're quite manageable). Thus,if someone with whom I was forming an emotional attachment turned out to bepositive, I think I would be able to continue the relationship. I wouldprobably evaluate the relationship in the context of a sex life that would nodoubt have some restrictions, which could potentially be an issue. But Ilearned a long time ago not to expect to have all my fantasies fulfilled.(Reality is more than enough fun, anyway.)Sorry for being so long winded.Gary",https://groups.google.com/g/net.motss/c/2q4B_NKkcnU/m/_OBfGlEr0Z4J,,,

I do not enter intorelationships blindly. If I have any doubt about the trustworthyness ofsomebody, I will not (I guess I should say would not, since I'm taken)even date them.

(Why keep all the stuff in one place?) I wonder if there aren'tcases where having all those extra nerves is just asking for trouble.It would seem to me (naively) that nerve paths provide a sort ofinterstate highway map for some kinds of viruses to follow, and thericher a nervous system you have the more inroads they can find. (I'mthinking of herpesviruses; I had shingles about ten years ago.)I seem to remember hearing about some research in which someone showedthat intelligence is selected against in rats. Anybody know aboutthis? (Some people will probably suggest it is also selected againstwhere my family comes from.) There are certainly constraints againstbrain size, e.g. an infant's brain at birth is limited in size by thesize of the birth canal. Stephen Jay Gould says one reason why thehuman baby is so helpless when born is that the human infant is a sortof fetus that got out of the womb too early. If it stayed in until itwas as developed as its mammalian counterparts it could not be bornwithout killing its mother. Anyway, there is a price to be paid forall this excess brain size.As for the 5%-95% argument, I don't take it too seriously. If somebodycame to me and said, `You're only using 5% of your brain, so let usscoop out the other 95%,' I'd probably decline the offer. I may beonly using 5%, but I want ALL of it.

From a logical standpoint, the issue should be: 1. Is sodomy harmful? 2. If is is, does the government have the right to legislate against sodomy in order to protect society from its harmful effects? For example, murder is harmful and society should be protected. Cigarette smoking is harmful, but individuals are permitted to make their own decision. But sodomy is not even harmful (in fact ""oral sex"" is a safe method for birth control). Therefore, the second question is not relevant. Frankly, I'm stunned that such blatent puritanical laws are being upheld by the supreme court. Logic has been cast aside by the reactionary backlash.

How about laws that are unenforced or almost unenforcable? Laws that many people break routinely? Laws with apparently no logical basis? These laws contribute towards lack of respect for the law in general. Once somebody regards one ridiculous law as a joke, how much more does it take to spread this attitude to law in general? Or what about ridiculous lawsuits, say suing the makers of a ladder because they didn't specifically state that you should be sure it is planted securely? Seems to me that THIS contributes to ""moral decay"". -Dwight",https://groups.google.com/g/net.singles/c/x4HfOYalFfw/m/jqz6hYgLq5EJ,,,

Now with polygamy, the wives could all gang up on him. You can develop a strong argument for polygamy based on the protectionist attitudes toward women common in just about any period of history. Women need a man to provide protection and status. Women are incapable of handling their own financial affairs (remember, I'm pretending to be a protectionist. THIS IS NOT REALLY ME! Okay?). Some women manage to escape male protection - widows and single women who have no male guardians. The more women a man marries, the more he protects. Fewer poor widows and destitute spinsters become a financial burden on the community, church, state, whatever. (The term spinster came about because unmarried women in England circa 1600, I think, were required by law to do so many hours of spinning per day - to keep them out of trouble and make sure they were productive members of socity.) If you have a male-dominated society, it kind of makes sense to have the male dominate as many females as he can, no?

Actually the swing justice (I think it was the Chief Justice, but not sure) said that the court can only rule on the constitutionality if there was actually a case where the law was used to prosecute. Since no prosecution came from this, the justice ruled that it wasn't the court's business at this time (maybe later... when a sodomy case was actually prosecuted). Still sounds fuzzy, though.

Marriage with many husbands is called polyandry (polyandria?). As far as a better deal for women because of polygamy, I would be sceptical. Consider divorce: the complexity would grow exponentially. Also, it would be possibly easier to get a fraction of an attractive husband, but more difficult to get a whole husband. I think that marriage laws are in a sence regulating the possible status of individuals concerning taxes and benefits. Allowing polygamy would throw IRS, employer benefit offices and welfare administration into a tailspin. (For this reason Mormons were banished: people did not have IRS, etc., and they knew how difficult it would be to create those institutions would polygamy be allowed.

Indeed, health statistics over the last six months or so indicate that the greatest percentage of new cases are transmitted by infected intraveinous drug users sharing dirty needles or from heterosexual sexual relations with prostitutes (who have a large intersection with the drug user population.)

Since no prosecutioncame from this, the justice ruled that it wasn't the court's business at thistime (maybe later... when a sodomy case was actually prosecuted). Stillsounds fuzzy, though.
